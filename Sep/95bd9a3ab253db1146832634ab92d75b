JOHANNESBURG - Mining investment opportunities in Kenya’s counties, case studies from successful mining projects, an update on the gemstone, artisanal and small-scale sector and how new technology can impact mining will be some of the focal points during the upcoming Kenya Mining Forum in Nairobi from November 12 -13. The programme will also discuss how the mining sector can forge synergies with its manufacturing and infrastructure counterparts, as well as financing and regulatory challenges. The expo is expected to be double the size of last year with more than 40 suppliers showcasing the latest local and international solutions and services for mining operations. Mining staff can hone their practical skills at the free technical workshops on the expo floor and there is a new outdoors equipment display area where some of the larger technology can be test driven. - African News Agency (ANA)
