Cape Town - If you think the saying “it’s a dog’s life” is about difficult times, you’re barking up the wrong tree, after taking a peek inside the lives of guests at the @frits Hotel in Cape Town. The doggy stopover will vie for glory as Guinness Book of Records’ biggest dog hotel on the planet when it opens in a new 2400m² Bree Street home later this year. Owner and founder Yanic Klue explains that each dog’s room is lovingly curated to ooze glitz and quirkiness and, of course, comfort. The hotel has a dog day spa and salon; and even offers Doggy Dating, aka “Fun Times in the Indoor Dog Park”, where owners and dogs can play inside while it's raining in the Mother City. There's even a bar area for pets although they don’t as yet have a Yappy Hour. Click here to see how your pooches can be pampered.
