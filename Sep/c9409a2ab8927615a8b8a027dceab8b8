Gigaba said by allowing inward migration of skilled workers such as investors, doctors, researchers and others through our visa and permit regime would boost our national development. “Our task is to make entry into South Africa for these visitors as easy as possible, while guarding against the risks posed by the minority of travellers who do not abide by our laws, those who overstay, and persons associated with transnational threats such as organised crime, human trafficking and terrorism. ‘It is a challenge inherent in immigration management to detect, prevent and act against these risks without unduly inconveniencing law-abiding travellers,” Gigaba said. He, however, warned that his department was committed to finding and implementing innovative immigration management solutions to positively impact on tourism and economic development.
