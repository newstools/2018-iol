CAPE TOWN - The Diaspora African Forum, in partnership with the African Union Commission, is once again set to host the African Women of Excellence Awards (AWEA), recognising the most outstanding women of African descent and around the world. The AWEA, a premier awards celebration honouring the role of African women, is set this year to honour iconic female figures which made a historic impact in the fields of government, civil society, and entertainment, including the late anti-apartheid activist and politician Winnie Madikizela Mandela, Liberian politician Ruth Sando Perry, and the late queen of soul Aretha Franklin. In 2017, the AWEA recognised the President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, for the historical advancement of women in government, this after Kagame ensured 60 percent female representation in parliament, placing Rwanda at number 1 globally for female representation in government. "We are honoured to announce that H.E. Kwesi Quartey, Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission, will co-chair the event with Ambassador Erieka Bennett, Head of Mission, Diaspora African Forum," the AWEA said in a statement. The AWEA this year will have two distinct events, a gala dinner and a chat session themed "I Am My Sisterâ€™s Keeper". The events are set to take place on September 29-30 at the Michelangelo Hotel in Sandton City in Johannesburg. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
