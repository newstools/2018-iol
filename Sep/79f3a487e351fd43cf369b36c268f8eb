JOHANNESBURG - National Freedom Party (NFP) in KwaZulu Natal on Friday urged motorist traveling to Umkhosi woMhlanga - also known as Reed Dance Ceremony - taking place at KwaNongoma to respect and obey rules of the road and to ensure the safety of maidens remains a priority. Umkhosi woMhlanga, which will be held at the weekend, discourages girls and young women from engaging in sexual activities until they are married. "We have seen over the past years thousands of young girls participating in this event, which demonstrates the significance of this event. This event contributes a lot to the economy of KZN province and it has shown a massive support globally," said NFP Spokesperson Vikizitha Mlotshwa. "The NFP calls on the central government on basic education to show its support through emphasising abstinence rather than the distribution of condoms ...” He said his party was fully behind the practice of virginity testing a practice that has been criticised by rights bodies as being at odds with the Children's Act African News Agency (ANA)
