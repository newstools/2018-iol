WASHINGTON - Apple will hold a special event on Wednesday, and the excitement is building up over another expensive iPhone. WATCH   APPLE SHARES RISE Apple rose the most in five weeks on heavier-than-average volume as investors piled in on the eve of the company’s annual iPhone introduction. The shares rallied 2.5 percent Tuesday, increasing the gain since the start of the year to 32 percent. More than 35 million shares changed hands, which is 1.4 times the three-month average.
