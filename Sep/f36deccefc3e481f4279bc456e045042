JOHANNESBURG – The South African Post Office’s partnership with the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) was officially endorsed on Friday in what the Post Office chief executive described as a huge inter-governmental partnership. In a brief interview after the signing of the partnership Mark Barnes, Post Office chief executive said: “I’m very happy with this deal. This demonstrates that a partnership within the public service can be a good thing.”        The Post Office said earlier that it had completed upgrades to its national social grants IT system and the upgrades would give it the capacity to process grant payments.Sassa this week agreed to a rise in the monthly fees that the Post Office would charge for carrying out the social grant payments. The Post Office said it had paid 97 per cent of the 5..4 million social grant recipients who were using the new Sassa gold card and payment is ongoing at Sassa cash pay-points in line with the payment schedules. Sassa on Friday encouraged beneficiaries who were yet to migrate to the new Sassa gold card to do so before September 30 at any Sassa Local Office or Post Office. Beneficiaries must have their old Sassa card and green barcoded ID Book or Smart Card in order to be able to swop the old card for the new one. Meanwhile, Sassa in Mpumalanga called upon all grant beneficiaries who received their social grants through banks or use a pin to draw their money using the new Sassa gold card or personal bank accounts to access their money from September 29. They can access their money at any ATM or Merchant stores that displays the Visa sign around the country.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
