Cameroon ordered a 48-hour curfew in its English-speaking regions a day ahead of the one-year anniversary of a symbolic "independence" declaration by anglophone separatists, officials said on Sunday. "The movement of people between areas in the northwest will be banned for a period of 48 hours from Sunday, September 30 until Monday, October 1," said Adolphe Lele Lafrique, governor of the largely English-speaking northwest region. Similar measures will be enforced across Cameroon's other anglophone areas, officials told AFP. Hundreds of civilians and dozens of security forces are understood to have been killed in the majority French-speaking country's anglophone northwest and southwest this year. In October 2017, radical anglophone leaders declared a "Republic of Ambazonia" in the two English-speaking regions which were incorporated into francophone Cameroon in 1961. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
