Geneva - The United States was not able to register any achievements at the United Nations General Assembly meeting which took place this week, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Thursday. Rouhani and US President Donald Trump exchanged threats and insults during their speeches at theÂ 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly. "The Americans had no achievements in this public assembly," Rouhani said, at a news conference broadcast on state TV on his return to Tehran. The assembly had shown America's isolation, he said. "When Mr. Trump was speaking and at the beginning of his speech bragged a lot about the accomplishments of his two-year-old administration, everyone laughed." "What's important is that today, other than one or two countries, no one is supporting America," he said. "It's a historic political isolation that is rare for America." * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535. Reuters
