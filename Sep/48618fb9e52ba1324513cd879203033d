JOHANNESBURG – Agriculture industry body AgriSA has a standing policy to engage with all role-players in the country that work towards a sustainable, transformed and competitive agricultural sector, farmer and vice-president of the Free State Agriculture organisation, Tommie Esterhuyse, said on Monday. Last week, affiliated farmers from Gauteng, the Free State and North West, as well as industry leaders, had a discussions with South Africa’s largest trading partners as part of AgriSA’s continued engagement with key decision makers. “It is now the time for South Africans to stand together and promote our mutual interests, and not polarise the community,” said Esterhuyse. AgriSA and its farmer representatives discussed trade and the strengthened relations with international markets, farm security, as well as its opposition to expropriation without compensation (EWC) and farm land grabs. “In no way was any reference made to organisations and their actions. We had more than enough time to put our point across and there was general consensus that EWC is a bad idea,” said Esterhuyse. Esterhuyse said South African agriculture and trade relations was incredibly important for the sustainability of the economy. – African News Agency ANA
