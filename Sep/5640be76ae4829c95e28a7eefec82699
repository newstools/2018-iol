Bloemfontein - Two men were killed while 26 others were left injured, one critically, in a Bloemfontein accident, paramedics confirmed on Monday. The incident happened on Monday morning at around 7.30am on Christo Groenewald street in Northridge. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said ER24 paramedics, along with provincial Fire and Rescue Services and College EMS, arrived on the scene to find the truck lying on its roof on the side of the road. "Several people that had been on the back of the truck were found scattered around the scene. It is understood that the driver lost control of the vehicl, causing it to crash through a wall and roll. "Paramedics assessed the patients and found three men lying trapped inside the front of the vehicle. Unfortunately, two men had already succumbed to their multiple injuries and were declared dead." The third man was assessed and found to be in a critical condition. Meiring said fire and rescue services had to use specialised equipment to free the man from the truck and once freed, paramedics treated him and provided him with advanced life support interventions. "Approximately 25 other patients were attended to on the scene and an assessment showed that their injuries ranged from minor to serious," he said. The patients were treated for their injuries and were then taken to Pelonomi Provincial hospital for further care. Meiring confirmed that local authorities were on the scene to carry out further investigations. IOL
