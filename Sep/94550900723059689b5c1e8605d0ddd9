Pretoria - President Cyril Ramaphosa is delivering the 19th Annual Steve Biko Memorial Lecture, currently underway at the University of South Africa (Unisa). The annual lecture is hosted by the Steve Biko Foundation, in partnership with Unisa, and is taking place at the Z.K. Matthews Great Hall at the university's Muckleneuk campus. The lecture is the latest in a series of events held to commemorate the 41st anniversary of Biko's death. Biko was murdered at the Pretoria Central Prison on September 12, 1977 but the lecture will be held two days later to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the Steve Biko Foundation. Ramaphosa is a former member of the South African Students Organisation (SASO) - which Biko was its founding president.   * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
