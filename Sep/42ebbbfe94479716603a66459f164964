CAPE TOWN – Google announced that its group planning feature for Google Maps is now available for users.  (You can shortlist different places for your group to visit. Image by Google.) "Starting today, you can use Google Maps to easily plan where to go as a group. Simply long press on any place to add it to a shortlist - the small floating bubble on the side of your screen. Once you've added places, you can quickly share the list with your friends on any messaging platform, add or remove additional places, and vote together in Google Maps," said Sophia Lin, Senior Product Manager, Google Maps in a statement. First announced at May, at Google I/O 2018, the feature allows users to create a shortlist of restaurants or other destinations that can be shared with friends so they can vote if they want to go to the place in question. You can use the feature by long-pressing each location to drag into a shortlist, which can then be shared with the friends you invite. The group will be able to see the relative locations of each destination in their app or browser, and they can vote with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, and Google will keep score. Members of the group are also free to add their own suggestions. Group planning was just one of the new features Google announced for its navigation map. To get started, download the Google Maps app or update it from the Play Store or App Store. (Share the shortlist with friends. Image by Google.)
