Kabul - Islamic State on Thursday claimed responsibility for a twin bomb attack at a wrestling club in the Afghan capital Kabul the previous day that killed at least 26 people. At least 91 others were also wounded in the incident, Public Health Ministry spokesman Wahidullah Majroh said on Thursday. The bombings targeted a wrestling club in the Dashte Barchi neighbourhood in western Kabul, a mainly Shiite dominated area, Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi had told dpa on Wednesday. First a suicide bomber entered the club and blew himself up at around 6 pm (1330 GMT). Forty minutes later, as people were busy moving the casualties to ambulances, a car bomb went off in front of the club, Rahimi said. Journalists from various media outlets were among the casualties of the second explosion, said Hashmat Stanakzai, a spokesman for the Kabul police. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the bombings through their mouthpiece Amaq news agency, saying first a suicide bomber had targeted, "a gathering of apostates" in the neighbourhood. The claim went on to say that an explosive-packed vehicle was then blown up among first responders and journalists that killed and injured around 150 people. The incident represents the second bomb attack on a civilian building in western Kabul in less than a month. In August, a suicide bombing on an educational centre in the Afghan capital left 65 students dead and injured some 75 others. Since January, together with Wednesday's bombings, at least 17 attacks have taken place in Kabul, leaving at least 430 people dead. dpa
