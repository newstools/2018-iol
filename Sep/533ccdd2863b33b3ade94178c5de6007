Kagiso - West Rand police on Wednesday confirmed they are investigating after a shack fire claimed the lives of two children, the latest in a series of deadly fires this week. Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said police were called to a scene on Monday at around 4pm in Kagiso Ext 8 and told what had happened. "The 22-year-old mother alleged that she was outside doing laundry when she was informed that the shack was on fire. "It is alleged that she called for help but the fire was already uncontrollable." The woman's two children, aged two and eight months respectively, were inside the shack and both died. Masondo confirmed that an inquest docket had been opened and that police were continuing with investigations to determine the cause of fire and death of victims. News of the Kagiso shack fire comes as a Philippi man mourns the death of his partner their three children, who were killed in a shack fire in Browns Farm. In Alexandra meanwhile, two women face negligence and culpable charges after four children died in a shack fire while the women were allegedly out drinking at a shebeen. The two have since appeared in court and were denied bail. IOL
