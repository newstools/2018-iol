Lesley John Paulse, 67, fondly known as Boeta Les, was killed on Friday while fetching medication for his wife, Veronica, 63. Witnesses say shortly before he was shot by suspects, Boeta Les took off his cap and told the gunmen: “Dit is ek, Boeta Les.” But they still opened fire and left the elderly man to die in the street. He was rushed to Hanover Park Day Hospital, but died as a result of the shooting. On Wednesday shortly after 7pm, residents gathered in St. Lucia Court where the oupa lived for more than 40 years, to honour the man they say did everything he could to help his neighbours. The group, which consisted mostly of children, sang gospel songs as they mourned his death at a memorial hosted by the Shiloh Pentecostal Church. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, says Boeta Les was a nice person who had a soft spot for children, whose broken shoes he often mended free of charge. His daughter, Shaqeelah Carollisen, said: “The children who came are all the kids he helped by fixing their school shoes and soccer balls. “They are also the children who he walked to school in the morning to make sure that they are safe. “The service was beautiful and we are grateful for all the support from the community during this difficult time.” Shaqeelah says they were hoping to have the funeral this weekend but due to a backlog at the mortuary, they will have to wait until next week for her father’s body. Meanwhile, cops say no arrests have been made despite the shooter having been identified by residents. “People saw it and know who it is, but nobody has come forward to make a statement,” says a police source.
