 London - A woman of 83 has been arrested on suspicion of murdering her 85-year-old husband in what police described as a ‘tragic domestic incident’. Grandfather Alan Grayson, who had been married to his wife Marjorie for 60 years, died from a stab wound. Police were called to the semi-detached house in Sheffield just before 9.45 am yesterday. Mr Grayson was treated by paramedics at the house but died a short time later. The woman was arrested at the scene. A 57-year-old woman, who lives a few doors away, spoke of her ‘disbelief’ at what had happened. She said the couple had lived in the house since before she was born and she had known them her whole life. Mr Grayson, who was named locally, had been an architect and Mrs Grayson worked at a local garage. They had two sons and a number of grandchildren. The neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I’d been on an early shift this morning then came home and saw all this happening. ‘They were lovely – always just pottering around in their garden and always stopped for a proper chat. They were one of the originals from the street still left. It’s just hard to believe – I’m so upset.’ She said police had knocked on her door to ask what kind of relationship the elderly couple had and whether they had ever been seen arguing. She said officers had described it as a ‘tragic domestic incident’. The woman added: ‘They used to go out walking together all the time. That’s why this is so hard to get your head around.’ A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said emergency services were called to the house following a report that the 85-year-old man was seriously injured. ‘The man was treated for a stab wound at the scene but sadly died shortly after. An 83-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Police are not looking for anyone else in connection to the incident.’  Daily Mail
