DURBAN - Despite grim news this week that South Africa had fallen into a technical recession this, President Cyril Ramaphosa will lace up his trainers and don his track suit for the now famous Ramaphosa Walk in Durban on Saturday. The president's walk became popular when he took over office at the start of the year, walking with scores of people in Cape Town. Initially, Ramaphosa would walk in Sea Point, Cape Town, with former finance minister Trevor Manuel. Pictures surfaced on social media and ever since, he has taken his morning walks across the country to promote a healthy lifestyle. The walks hit Durban this weekend, where Ramaphosa was also set to address the community in Chatsworth. Ramaphosa will on Saturday morning walk with the Durban public from 6am to 7.30am, from the Princess Magogo Stadium to Bridge City Mall in KwaMashu, north of Durban. The 3 killometre route is depicted below.   Members of the public have been invited to join the president. Ramaphosa's early morning health walks have become a regular event across the country with thousands of South Africans joining him to better their health. Ramaphosa previously said that he wanted his “tummy to fall”, so he would continue with his regular morning walks. “We are calling on society to come out and join the President so we can show that we are striving towards being a healthy nation. These initiatives teaches us about living a healthy lifestyle while not having to spend a lot of money,” said ANC KZN spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu. She said South Africa ranked poorly in terms of countries that lived healthily and the president’s morning walks was an attempt to change this.
