Rustenburg - A man and woman have been rescued from their light aircraft after it became entangled in a zip-line, paramedics said on Friday. The aircraft was stuck approximately 300 metres above the ground at a resort outside of Rustenburg. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said ER24 paramedics, along with provincial services, SAPS and mountain search and rescue, were called to the scene on Friday morning at around 8.30am by a member of the public who had noticed the aircraft. "Rescue services utilised various high-angle rescue techniques to reach the patients in the aircraft. After some time, rescuers reached the aircraft and found the man and woman inside the aircraft. "Rescue personnel equipped both patients with harnesses and began to lower them to the awaiting paramedics, 300 metres below. Once safely on the ground, paramedics found that both patients had fortunately escaped injury." The pair were transported to a nearby private hospital for further assessment and later explained to paramedics the only thing they could do was not to move as they feared the aircraft would fall. The details surrounding the incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
