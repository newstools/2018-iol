Washington - A new woman claimed on Wednesday to have witnessed sexually abusive behavior by Brett Kavanaugh and said she was gang-raped at a party in the early 1980s attended by the Supreme Court nominee. Julie Swetnick said in a statement released by her lawyer that the events took place at parties she attended while a high school student in suburban Maryland. She said she saw Kavanaugh "drink excessively" and "engage in abusive and physically aggressive behavior towards girls" that included "fondling and grabbing of girls without their consent." Swetnick also said that she was raped at a party in approximately 1982 at which Kavanaugh was present. Swetnick's statement was released by her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, the attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels, who has claimed to have had a sexual encounter with Donald Trump. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
