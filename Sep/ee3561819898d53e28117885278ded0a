JohannesburgÂ - Britain's Prince William is in Africa this week to focus on one of his passions: wildlife conservation. Pictures of his trip to Namibia, posted by Kensington Palace on Wednesday, showed William, clad in safari colours, out on a bush walk with a team of Namibian rhino trackers and meeting with local villagers. The prince's trip - his first to the southern African nation - began Monday. "My visit to Namibia this week is focused on conservation. This is an issue very close to my heart, and I know is a matter of deep pride to you all as well," he said Tuesday in a speech at the British High Commission in Windhoek, Namibia's capital.      "Your country's famous for its beautiful environment and its wildlife... tourism continues to grow year on year," said William, 36, second in line to the British throne.        "I'm only sorry that my wife Katherine is not able to join me, she is immensely jealous," he added, joking that he was looking forward to getting some sleep - away from his three young children.      "The latest figures show that a rhino is killed every seven hours. The Illegal Wildlife trade is an international problem that requires determined political leadership," he said.       On Thursday, William will be in Tanzania to meet President John Magafuli and discuss efforts to combat the illegal wildlife trade in the East African country. His last stop, over the weekend, is Kenya, where he is to visit British and Kenyan soldiers who are training together. dpa
