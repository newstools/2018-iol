Durban - The mother of Baby X who this week was found guilty of murdering the 3-year-old as well as a string of child abuse-related charges, has no previous convictions. This emerged when the 35-year-old appeared briefly in the Durban High Court on Friday. Judge Mohini Moodley postponed the hearing to November 1 to begin the sentencing proceedings. The womanâ€™s mother, who was also accused of the charges, died of natural causes in April in custody. The two had been incarcerated since November 2014, when Baby X was found dead in their Havenside, Chatsworth, home. The child abuse charges on which the mother was found guilty included charges against two of her older children. Other charges relating to Baby X included depriving her of food, failing to get her medical help, tying her to her bed and placing chilli powder in her nappy. Arguments of aggravation of sentence by the State and mitigation of sentence by the defence are expected to take up the November 1 hearing. Independent on Saturday
