Tokyo - A powerful typhoon accompanied by heavy rain and strong winds was set to make landfall in western Japan on Tuesday as more than 500 flights and many train services were cancelled. Weather agency officials were warning of floods, strong winds, high waves and torrential rains for large parts of the country. Typhoon Jebi is projected to make landfall on the south-western island of Shikoku or Kii Peninsula around noon (0300 GMT), according to the Meteorological Agency. As of 8 am (2300 GMT Monday), the eye of the storm was located some 90 kilometres south-east of Cape Ashizuri on Shikoku, travelling north-north-east at 35 kilometres per hour (kph) with maximum sustained winds of 162 kph and gusts of 216 kph, the agency said. Rainfall of up to 500 millimetres was forecast for the Tokai region and up to 400 millimetres for the Kinki and Kanto regions, including Tokyo, by Wednesday morning, according to the agency. In early July, torrential rains battered western Japan, triggering landslides and floods that left 226 dead and 10 missing - the country's deadliest weather-related disaster in more than three decades. dpa
