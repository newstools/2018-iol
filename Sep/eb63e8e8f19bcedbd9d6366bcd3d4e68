Johannesburg – The UN has urged Malawi to prosecute those responsible for murdering albino MacDonald Masambuka, 22, who went missing in February. His butchered body was found in April with his legs and arms missing. Maria Jose Torres, the UN Resident Coordinator in the African country, has welcomed the end of investigations into his killing. Twelve people - among them a police officer and a priest - have entered pleas on a series of charges that include murder and causing harm to persons with disabilities. Torres added that the UN remains concerned about continued attacks against persons with albinism. In some communities, albinos are attacked or even killed for their body parts which are erroneously believed to possess magical powers. At least 10 people with albinism remain missing in Malawi, according to Torres. She said the most recent case concerns Joseph Kashingwe, a 12-year-old boy who disappeared in July after attending independence celebrations. Another boy, aged five, narrowly escaped abduction just last month. African News Agency/ANA
