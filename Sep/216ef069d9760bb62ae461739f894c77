Johannesburg - ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu says a Sunday Times report claiming that former president Jacob Zuma and his supporters are allegedly involved in a plot to oust the current ANC leadership deserves "urgent attention". A report emerged on Sunday claiming that Zuma had "secretly" met with ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo, ANC Women's League secretary-general Meokgo Matuba as well as ANC Youth League KZN secretary Thanduxolo Sabeo at the Maharani Hotel in Durban. The meeting was held to reportedlyÂ plan the ousting of the leadership of the ANC, in particular, President Cyril Ramaphosa. Reacting to the report, Mthembu tweeted that the matter deserved urgent attention as such "plots" undermined "the unity and renewal efforts of the ANC".      "More seriously disturbing in the alleged clandestine plot, is the undermining of our state in its efforts to fight and reverse impacts of " state capture. "Those involved in this plot also want to undermine the ANC 2019 election campaign so as to produce disastrous results."      The party meanwhile, has rubbished the report, calling it "sensational hot air" and adding that it would not dignify "blatant lies" with a detailed response. "However, we would like to point out that we refute this shameless gossip. We also reject attempts to link our secretary general cde Ace Magashule to this alleged plot to oust the president of the ANC cde Cyril Ramaphosa. It is clear that this malicious gossip is calculated to cast aspersions on the integrity and commitment of our secretary general to the unity and renewal project of the African National Congress," party spokesperson Pule Mabe said in a statement. Sabelo has also since denied being part of the meeting, adding that he was seeking legal advice on the report. IOL
