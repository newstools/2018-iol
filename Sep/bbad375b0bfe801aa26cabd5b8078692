New York - President Cyril Ramaphosa is addressing the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA73), currently underway in New York. This year’s session marks Ramaphosa’s inaugural participation in UNGA as head of state and government, where he is expected to outline South Africa’s domestic and foreign policy goals and priorities. These included the country’s land reform programme "aimed at fostering greater stability, inclusiveness, and transformation within the South African economy". The UN general debate was preceded by the unveiling of a statue of former president Nelson Mandela and the historic Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, a high-level plenary meeting convened by the President of the General Assembly Maria Espinosa in honour of the centenary of the birth of South Africa’s first democratically elected president. The UNGA73 is running from September 25 and will conclude on September 27. Watch Ramaphosa's address here:   * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. Politics Hub
