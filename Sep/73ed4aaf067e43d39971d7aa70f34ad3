CAPE TOWN – Sony announced that its PlayStation Now streaming service will be getting a game downloads to feature.  What is PlayStation Now? It is a subscription platform where users can stream PS2, PS3, and PS4 titles. However, now users will be able to download those games for offline play as well. According to Sony, “almost all” PS4 games will support downloads, as will all PS2 titles. Brian Dunn Senior Marketing Manager at PlayStation Now said in a statement: "Almost all PS4 games in the service, including Bloodborne, God of War 3 Remastered, NBA 2K16, and Until Dawn, will be available for download, in addition to the PS Now lineup of classic PS2 games remastered for PS4." The company added that users will able to transfer save data from the cloud to their console so that they can play without an internet connection. “You will need to connect your PS4 system to the internet every few days to verify your PS Now subscription, even if you’re only playing downloaded games", said Dunn. PlayStation Now is currently being offered at a discounted $9.99-a-month (R142.35) rate and $99.99 a year. It will offer more than 600 games, including Bloodborne, Red Dead Redemption, and The Last of Us. South African pricing and availability are yet to announced.
