Machadodorp - Two white men are facing assault GBH charges after they were captured manhandling a black man in a Mpumalanga town earlier this week. In a video that surfaced on social media, the security guards are seen dragging the man in Machadodorp and at one point, manhandling him before violently loading him onto a van. All this while a crowd of onlookers question on what authority the assault is being carried out. Police are then seen arriving at the scene and try to intervene, but seemingly to no avail. The alleged assault resulted in protests and the closure of the N4 between Machadodorp and Carolina, Lowvelder reported.      Mpumalanga police spokesperson ColonelÂ Mtsholi Bhembe confirmed the arrest of the two men following the incident. "It's alleged that the victim had a quarrel with another man employed by a local businessman in the area on Monday. It seems that as they were fighting, the owner reportedly called a local security company. When they arrived, they manhandled the victim and loaded him onto their van," he said. Bhembe was unable to confirm if the two also assaulted the man prior to loading him onto the van, saying that the matter was reported to the police and a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH) was opened. He would also not be drawn into claims that the attack was racially motivated, only saying that the victim only laid an assault charge. The two appeared at the Belfast Magistrate's Court and were remanded in custody. "They will appear again on Thursday for a bail application," Bhembe said. IOL
