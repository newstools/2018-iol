Johannesburg - A memorial service for the three fallen firefighters will be held on Wednesday at theÂ Ellis Park Arena. Simphiwe Moropane, Mduduzi Ndlovu and Khathutshelo Muedi died while battling the blaze at the Bank of Lisbon Building in the Joburg CBD last week. A magnetic door that had not been disengaged at the time of the fire is alleged to have trapped the three firemen inside the burning building. One died after slipping out the window and falling to his death, the other was burnt while the third died of smoke inhalation. On Monday, a group of mourners gathered outside the building to lay wreaths in remembrance of the fallen men. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
