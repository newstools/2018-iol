Gaza - Three Palestinians were shot and killed during clashes with Israeli soldiers along the Gaza Strip border, where Palestinians have been holding protests nearly every week. Among the dead was a 14-year-old who had been shot in the chest, the Health Ministry in Gaza said Friday. In addition, more than 190 Palestinians were injured, including 47 with gunshot wounds. According to the Israeli army, more than 10,000 Palestinians had gathered along various points of the border security fence and threw petrol bombs, explosives and stones at soldiers. In reaction, the Israeli air force attacked a base of Hamas, Gaza's ruling group. Since the end of March, 189 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers at the border, according to the ministry. Palestinians have been staging marches along theÂ Gaza border since March, calling for an end to the Israeli blockade of Gaza and other demands. Israel says the marches are veiled attempts by the Islamist Hamas group to carry out attacks on the border area. dpa
