Six candidates were interviewed by a selection panel of the party’s top brass. Apart from Volmink and Plato, the candidates are Mayco member for urban development and transport Brett Herron, Western Cape Legislature Speaker Sharna Fernandez, current deputy mayor Ian Neilson and city DA member Sumaya Taliep. They were interviewed by five members of the DA’s Cape Town region, five from its provincial leadership and 10 from the party's federal executive (FedEx). Plato said the interview was a rigorous process. “I cannot divulge all the details, but the atmosphere was very encouraging. There were some tough questions. I spoke about the future of the city and the solid foundation that there is already,” he said. Herron, who is seen as a supporter of mayor Patricia de Lille, said: “The panel asked some tough and relevant questions. I had the opportunity to share my vision and priorities for the city, bearing in mind that we have a local government manifesto to implement.” Volmink did not want to discuss the day’s proceedings. He is seen as a favourite by the DA national FedEx, although he has little connection to the Cape Town caucus. “I really cannot say anything until the embargo is lifted,” he said. De Lille will leave her position by October 31. DA communications director Mabine Seabe said all the interviews were concluded on Monday. “There will be a FedEx meeting today and there’s a very strong possibility that an outcome will be announced,” he said. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
