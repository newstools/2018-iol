Rustenburg - Nine people were arrested on suspicion of murder and public violence following clashes in Klerksdorp, North West police said on Monday. Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said the nine aged between 22 and 52 were arrested on Sunday, after a clash between taxi drivers and foreign nationals in Pienaarsdorp. "It is alleged that an unconfirmed number of taxi drivers grouped themselves with the intention to avenge their colleague’s death who they alleged was killed by foreign nationals," said Mokgwabone. "According to information available at this stage, reports suggest that later during the day, a 28-year-old Zimbabwean national was allegedly stabbed with a knife in the chest by taxi drivers while at his tuck-shop. He was taken to a hospital, but was certified dead on arrival." Before the incident, a group of people suspected to be taxi drivers were seen setting alight hawkers stalls at the taxi rank. Public Order Police managed to restore order. The nine arrested for the alleged murder of a Zimbabwean national were expected to appear in the Klerksdorp Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. African News Agency (ANA)
