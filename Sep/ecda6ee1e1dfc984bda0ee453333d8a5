INTERNATIONAL – Pot is starting to pay off. A surge in the share prices of cannabis companies has made millionaires, and even billionaires, out of investors. The pot-stock boom is expanding across the industry, with the most extreme example, Tilray, seeing its shares catapult about 13-fold in the months since its July initial public offering. Now, these marijuana men are worth millions or at least on paper. Given the volatility of stocks in the sector, their fortunes may be fleeting. 1.
