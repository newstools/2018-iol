Kimberley - A hijacked police vehicle has been recovered in Kuruman.Police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Dimakatso Mooi, said that a member of the Kuruman Crime Intelligence unit was hijacked in his official vehicle while on duty early on Sunday morning. “It is alleged that on Sunday, at about 2am, a member of Kuruman Crime Intelligence was on duty and departing from an event that was held at the Second Eye, Kuruman. As the member was waiting for traffic to pass on the N14, he was approached by two suspects asking for a lift. “He told them that he is not going to town.
