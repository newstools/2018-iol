CAPE TOWN -  Today, The National Small Business Chamber (NSBC) and World Famous Events celebrate Small Business Friday for its seventh consecutive year. The aim of this day is to push forward a movement that calls on South Africans to choose small and make a big impact by supporting small business. Mike Anderson, NSBC Founder and CEO said: "Friday 07 September marks Small Business Friday, but it’s about so much more than just one day. We’re aiming to bring about permanent change so small businesses can thrive all year round with the backing of all South Africans". Anderson believes that by getting involved in Small Business Friday, South Africans will be able to lend their much-needed support to small businesses so they can grow, employ more, reduce unemployment, and nurture the country’s entrepreneurial spirit. “If everyone goes big by supporting the small, local businesses can build infrastructure, employ more people from within their communities, and play a more meaningful role in building the nation.
