CAPE TOWN – Apple has announced that it has successfully completed its acquisition of Shazam, the popular song identification app. “Apple and Shazam have a long history together. Shazam was one of the first apps available when we launched the App Store and has become a favourite app for music fans everywhere,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music in a statement. In December 2017, the company confirmed it was buying Shazam and its development team for a reported $400 million (R5 740 bn). “With a shared love of music and innovation, we are thrilled to bring our teams together to provide users even more great ways to discover, experience and enjoy music," said Schusser. The acquisition was temporarily held up because of an investigation by the European Union, which scrutinized the deal over potential antitrust concerns. Luckily, regulators gave it the thumbs up earlier this month. In what’s sure to be welcome news for Shazam users, Apple has announced that it will be removing all ads from the app “soon", this includes the Android version of the app. According to Apple, Shazam has been downloaded over 1 billion times around the world and is used over 20 million times every day. – BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
