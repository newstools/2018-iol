Polokwane - Human error is believed to be the cause of the fatal Limpopo bus crash. This is according to a preliminary investigation by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC). Authorities are still probing the cause of Friday morning’s crash that claimed the lives of ten people. The crash happened near the Caltex garage as the bus was leaving Polokwane. Limpopo Transport department spokesperson Matome Moremi said the bus driver lost control of the vehicle and overturned. This accident comes only a few days after another tragic Limpopo bus crash. On Monday, a bus reportedly travelling from Zambia to Gauteng overturned. It is believed that the bus had a tyre burst. The driver then lost control and veered off the road. "More needs to be done to curb the spate of bus crashes in the country as one incident claims more lives compared to others modes of road transport," said the RTMC in a statement. IOL
