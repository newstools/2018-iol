Port Elizabeth - A 40-year-old Port St Johns police sergeant has appeared in court on 14 counts of fraud amounting to R42 000. Hawks spokesperson, Captain Anelisa Feni, said sergeant Melumzi Mnakaniso appeared in the Port St Johns Magistrate's Court on Friday on fraud charges. Mnakaniso is attached to the Qumbu Police and was arrested last Thursday following anÂ investigation into alleged fraudulent subsistence and travel allowances claims. These were submitted for apparent official trips to Port Elizabeth that took place between 2012 and 2014, while he was stationed at Lusikisiki Police Station. Feni said it was further alleged that he submitted fraudulent subpoenas under the pretence that he was attending court cases - whereas these cases had been either finalised or withdrawn. Mnakaniso is also accused of submitting invoices from a Port Elizabeth Bed and Breakfast which no longer exists. He also allegedly submitted claims for taxi fare after obtaining false invoices from a local taxi association. The officer was granted bail of R1500. He is expected back in court on November 12.
