Port Elizabeth - Nelson Mandela Bay City Manager Johann Mettler has been placed on precautionary suspension on Thursday, pending an independent investigation into allegations of gross misconduct. The matter was discussed and resolved behind closed doors at a lengthy special council meeting on Thursday. After chaos erupted on Tuesday, the special sitting reconvened to consider three items including allegations of misconduct against Mettler. Earlier this month, the council resolved to issue Mettler with a notice of intent to suspend him. Executive Mayor Mongameli Bobani of the United Democratic Movement (UDM) has previously accused Mettler of misappropriating municipal funds. Allegations against Mettler involve him unlawfully extending the contract of communication firm Mohlaleng Media. Nelson Mandela Bay political leadership made no formal press announcements after the sitting. Municipal Spokesperson Mthubanzi Mniki said employee matters could not be addressed at this stage as it went against communication protocol. However, sources who cannot be named due to the confidential nature of the meeting, confirmed Mettler’s suspension. It is understood that that the African National  Congress, UDM, Patriotic Alliance, United Front and  African Independent Congress all voted in favour of Mettler’s suspension while the Democratic Alliance, Congress of the People and the African Christian Democratic Party voted against it. ANA also understands that Executive Director for Human Settlements, Nolwandle Gqiba was the name raised for the Acting Municipal Manager. African News Agency/ANA
