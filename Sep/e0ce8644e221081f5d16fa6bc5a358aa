RUSTENBURG - Tributes continue to pour on Friday for a North West teacher stabbed to death by a learner at school in Dinokana outside Zeerust. The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) in the North West said it was shocked and saddened by the death of the teacher. "We condemn this barbaric and criminal act in the strongest terms. We call on law enforcement agencies to fully investigate the matter and for strong action to be taken against the learner," said provincial secretary George Themba Gadimang Mokolobate, 24, a Maths teacher was stabbed on Thursday at Ramotshere Moiloa High School, allegedly by a 17-year-old boy. The Grade 10 learner allegedly knifed Mokolobate in the chest without saying a word. North West police said the teenager was due to appear in the Lehurutshe Magistrate's Court on Monday, facing a charge of murder. Themba said they expected schools to be weapon free. "We expect our schools to be free of drugs and weapons that can endanger the lives of both the teachers and learners. We reiterate our call for the Department of Education to address safety concerns and for Police to do random searches in our institutions. Further, we urge communities to take their rightful place and defend schools and teachers as violence against these institutions leads to the regression of society." The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in the North West together with Sadtu have long requested government, particularly the department of education and community safety to ensure that there was safety in school. "We call upon law enforcement to swiftly investigate the matter and impose a very harsh sentence to the perpetrator," said provincial secretary Job Dliso. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
