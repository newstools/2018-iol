CAPE TOWN – Microsoft and Amazon will partner again by bringing Skype calling to Alexa. Devices such as Amazon’s Echo range will be able to access Skype’s basic calling, and Alexa-powered hardware like the Echo Show will also include video calling support. Users will also be able to use Skype to call mobile and landlines using SkypeOut, and simply say “Alexa, call Bob on Skype” to activate a call. According to Microsoft, Skype calling on Alexa will be available “later this year,” and it follows a preview of Alexa and Cortana integration that’s available across Echo devices, Xbox One, and Windows 10 PCs. Microsoft and Amazon first partnered together for Alexa and Cortana in 2017 and it’s clear from this Skype calling effort that both companies are continuing to work closely. “We’re excited to continue bringing the best of Microsoft and Amazon together,” says Gaurav Sareen, corporate vice president for Microsoft. Users can make outgoing Skype voice and video calls, accept incoming Skype calls, and even make SkypeOut calls to most phone numbers around the world. For example, simply say, "Alexa, call Jimmy on Skype", or if Jimmy is calling you on Skype, say, "Alexa, answer". – BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
