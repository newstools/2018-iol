The Devil May Cry Series launched on the PS2 in the early 2000s and over the years has become quite an iconic series. It had a significant bump in the road, but has recovered fairly well. The HD Collection of the first three games is somewhat lacking though. The story can be downright ridiculous when it wants to be but for the silver-haired demon slayer, Dante, it just works. Some of the characters he meets along the way also help with the twists and occult-laden plots. Gameplay is the best part of the series; creating combos using Dante’s sword and twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory make for some stylish dispatching of enemies. Style also plays a big role in the game with all of your actions being rated as you play. The visuals have received an upgrade but it seems to be mostly where the character models are concerned. It’s a little disappointing, and to add to this, the camera can really work against you sometimes.   The Devil May Cry HD Collection is a great nostalgia trip if it’s been years since you’ve played the games and want to experience the magic of the series all over again. However, it will start to show its age when it comes to the fixed camera. This is problematic for newcomers though, as this may be an annoyance for some, while others will see it as a downright chore. The combat, characters and sometimes ridiculous plot twists make it worth a playthrough if you’ve never had the chance to play the original trilogy though.
