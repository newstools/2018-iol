RUSTENBURG - The Rustenburg local municipality will implement emergency water restrictions from Wednesday due to the high demand in water supply, the municipality said. Municipality spokesperson Andrew Seome said the Rand Water Barnardsvlei System and Rustenburg South System supplying town and CBD areas were under tremendous constraint due to high demand in water supply. "The command reservoir supplying all reservoirs in Rustenburg town and suburbs is currently at 30 percent. Emergency restrictions will be implemented to avoid the system running dry and most areas in Rustenburg being without water," he said. The restrictions were scheduled to commence from 7pm on Wednesday until 5am on Thursday morning. "This cycle will be repeated on a daily basis until further notice. Updates will be communicated as soon as the level is above 80 percent and when the system is sustainable." He said all extensions, including Cashan, Bo Dorp, Safari Gardens, Boschdal areas, parts of Geelhout Park, Waterfall East, Savannah Falls and Protea Park would have low to no pressure during the time frames communicated. "We urge residents to use water sparingly and avoid watering gardens and filling up swimming pools. The municipality would like to sincerely apologise for the inconvenience this may cause," he said. Residents of Boitekong, Sondela, Seraleng, Pardekraal, Sunrise, Ramochana, Freedom Park Extentions, Meriting Extentions and Boitekong Extentions would have daily water restrictions from 5pm on Wedneday to 7am the following day, in the Rand Water point of sale due to low reservoir levels at Magalies Water Bospoort. "This cycle will be repeated on daily basis until further notice. High lying areas will be experiencing no water while others experience low pressure,"  Seome added. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
