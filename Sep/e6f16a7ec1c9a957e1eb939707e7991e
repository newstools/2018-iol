Mahikeng - Two men accused of killing North West teacher Thulisile Ngwenya were arrested after their car was traced in Johannesburg, the North West High Court heard on Thursday. Sergeant Boitumelo Motsamai told the court that after Ngwenya's decomposing body was found, he went to a bank to investigate whether Ngwenya withdrew money from her account. "I saw her in the CCTV footage provided by Nedbank, she went to the self-service point and went to withdraw a R1000 at the ATM outside, I further went to Sport Scene at the Crossing Mall in Mahikeng, where a witness described the car the accused were driving," Motsamai said. "I trace the owner of the car to Midrand through its registration number and the accused, Headman Njokweni and Sifiso Ndawonde were arrested in Parktown, Johannesburg." A cashier at SportScene suspected the two and told them the machine was not working when they wanted to pay using a card, she then went outside and noticed the car the pair were driving and took down its registration number. She said Njokweni was the driver and Ndawonde was a passenger at the time of the arrest. Motsamai told the court that Ngwenya was reported missing on October 21, 2017, her car was found near the Nedbank in Mahikeng, while she was missing R2500 was withdrawn from her bank account at Southgate Mall in Johannesburg. Her body was found on October 25, she was half naked, flies and ants were feasting on her body. "A pair of yellow shoes, an empty chips container and a blue plastic were found near the body. There were marks on the ground indicating that she was dragged from one point before her body was dumped." Njokweni and Sifiso Ndawonde are facing charges of kidnapping, robbery, rape and murder.
