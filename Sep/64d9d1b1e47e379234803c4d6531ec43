East Goshen Township, Pennsylvania â€” A gunman authorities say shot at his ex-wife and then killed his parents in Pennsylvania has been found dead. Chester County District Attorney Tom Hogan said during a media briefing early Thursday that 59-year-old Bruce Rogal was dead after a manhunt and a police chase. Few other details are available. Hogan had said Wednesday that Rogal, of Glenmoore, received an order finalizing a divorce that awarded their home to his ex-wife and "that appears to be what set him off." Hogan says Rogal first went to the house where his ex-wife was staying, shot at her and missed. He then drove to a retirement centre in East Goshen Township and killed his parents, William and Nancy, both in their late 80s, and then fled. AP
