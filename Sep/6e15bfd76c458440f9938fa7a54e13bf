Johannesburg - The Centre for Applied Legal Studies (CALS) and the Black Sash Trust on Thursday said the Constitutional Court ruling against former social development minister, Bathabile Dlamini, was a victory for South Africans and sets an important precedent for holding public officials accountable. “We welcome today’s judgment and the impact this will have for grant beneficiaries going forward,” national director of the Black Sash, Lynette Maart Trust said. The Constitutional Court ordered that Dlamini be held personally liable for 20 percent of the Black Sash and Freedom Under the Law’s legal costs in the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) grants saga. Acting Deputy Director at CALS, Wandisa Phama said: “The judgment sets an important precedent for holding public officials accountable for their reckless and negligent actions in executing their duties. This is a step towards ensuring that a similar crisis never happens again.” African News Agency/ANA
