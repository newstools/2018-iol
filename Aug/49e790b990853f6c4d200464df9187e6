Cape Town - The discretion of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba to grant early naturalisation to some members of the Guptas has been flagged by a preliminary investigation of the parliament's research and legal services. Briefing the home affairs portfolio committee on Tuesday, parliamentary legal advisor Siviwe Njikela said the minister has the power to grant early naturalisation to a person who did not meet requirements. However, Njikela said it was established that Ajay Guptaâ€™s wife Shivani and his mother Angoori did not meet the requirements. He also said it was difficult to determine the circumstances Gigaba used to exercise his power. He said there could be a need to follow up on an explanation to understand what else was used other than submission. The committee resolved to look into the report in detail at its meeting on Wednesday. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. Political Bureau
