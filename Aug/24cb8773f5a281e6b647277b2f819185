JOHANNESBURG - Kenya's deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu has been arrested at the Supreme Court in Nairobi over alleged corruption. Judge Mwilu was on Tuesday taken to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations for questioning. Her arrest Tuesday followed a series of meetings by the Judicial Services Commission, the East African reported. Staff at the Supreme Court went about their business, with the majority avoiding contact with journalists. The arrest of such a high-ranking judicial staff member, unprecedented in Kenyaâ€™s history, is the culmination of weeks of investigations into brazen corruption at the judiciary, and is likely to send shockwaves throughout the institution. This latest development comes in the wake of a number of corruption scandals involving high-ranking and other government officials over the last few months which have rocked the East African country. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
