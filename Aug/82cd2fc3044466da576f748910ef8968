Gaza City - One Palestinian was killed and dozens injured by Israeli gunfire during protests along the Gaza border on Friday, a Gaza Health Ministry spokesman said. The protests come despite Hamas announcing late Thursday that a ceasefire had been reached with Israel after two days of cross-border fire that killed three Palestinians, including one Hamas militant. Ashraf al-Qedra, spokesman for the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry, said the killed Palestinian was a volunteer medic treating demonstrators along the border. At least 45 Palestinians were injured by Israeli gunfire on Friday and 35 others were hospitalized for other injuries sustained during the protests, al-Qedra said. Hamas has been orchestrating near-weekly protests along the Gaza border since March 30. Since then over 160 Palestinians have been killed in the protests and confrontations with Israeli army. Israel says that Hamas - considered a terrorist group by the US and much of the West - is using the protests as a mask to attempt attacks on Israeli border communities. The truce was brokered overnight by Egypt and UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov, according to Hamas-run al-Aqsa television. Israel has not confirmed the agreement but a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier Thursday evening that the security cabinet had "instructed the [Israeli Defence Forces] to continue to act with force against perpetrators of terror." * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. dpa
