Pretoria - Gauteng police confirmed they are investigating a murder case after a police officer's decomposed body was discovered in Pretoria last week. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo on Monday said the Sergeant's body was discovered in a veld near Strachan Street in Danville on Friday. The 43-year-old man had reportedly been missing since June this year. Details around his disappearance remain sketchy but Masondo explained that the officer was last seen leaving work. "He knocked off but never made it home... his personal belongings were found in a bag next to his body," he said. Masondo was unable to provide more details on the officer's disappearance, adding that police were still investigating the circumstances. No arrests have been made but Masondo confirmed that a murder case had been opened. This incident comes days after two off-duty police officers were murdered in two separate incidents in the Western Cape. Constable Lonwabo Kili, 30, was shot dead in the Delft area and Constable Siyamcela Ncipa, 37, was shot dead in Khayelitsha. Their firearms were stolen in both cases, police spokesperson Reneilwe Serero said in a statement on Saturday. * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535. IOL
