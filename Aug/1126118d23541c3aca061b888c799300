JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng company Today’s Destiny Traders says its participation at a trade fair in Mozambique starting later this month will help it establish a profile in an emerging economy in the throes of an infrastructural energy boom. The energy company which designs and produces transformers and signalling equipment is part of a business delegation that will showcase local products and services at the South African pavillion hosted by the department of trade and industry during the Feira International de Maputo on August 27 - September 3. “Our observations have shown that Mozambique consists of a lot of pole transformers and that most large contracts in the country are dominated by big multinational companies," Today’s Destiny Traders managing director Peter Madlala said. "What is advantageous to us as a small and emerging exporter of services is that we can dominate in the repair part of the business." - African News Agency (ANA)
