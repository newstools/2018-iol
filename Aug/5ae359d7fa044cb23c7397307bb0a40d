INTERNATIONAL - American telecommunications company Sprint announced that it will work with LG to release a 5G smartphone for Sprint’s nascent next-gen network sometime in the first half of 2019. There are no concrete details for the device other than a release date and that LG will be developing the device. Sprint’s press release highlights its use of Massive MIMO technology as part of the 5G strategy that the new unnamed LG phone will support. There’s no mention of other technologies, like mmWave frequencies, although the technology does exist to build support for that into a smartphone, too. Sprint isn’t the only network starting to lay the groundwork for 5G, either. Motorola has already promised a 5G Moto Mod for the Moto Z3 that will support Verizon’s next-gen network sometime in 2019 as well. Dr. John Saw, Sprint chief technology officer said: "Sprint is moving fast on the road to 5G and we are thrilled to announce the first 5G smartphone with the innovative team at LG,". "LG has done tremendous work developing technical designs that enable us to be among the first movers in mobile 5G." - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
