Johannesburg - Advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi have made submissions to President Cyril Ramaphosa on why they should not be suspended pending inquiries into their fitness to hold office. Ramaphosa announced two weeks ago that he will be instituting inquiries into the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) employees' fitness to hold office. Lawyer Zola Majavu, who represents the two, has confirmed that the representations have been filed on time. “It’s is done, we will await the president’s decision and then we will make a determination,” said Majavu. The president said the inquiry was crucial because of the importance of the public’s trust in the NPA. "I cannot underscore the importance of the public’s trust in the NPA and its most senior management. It is a constitutional institution that is central to the proper administration of justice. Doubt about the fitness and integrity of anyone in so senior a position as you hold jeopardises this trust and the ability of the NPA as a whole,” said. Both Jiba, the deputy National Director of Public Prosections, and Mrwebi, Special Director of Public Prosecution, were placed on special leave in 2016 and last year the Pretoria High Court set aside a decision by NPA head Shaun Abrahams to withdraw fraud and perjury charges against Jiba. They were barred from performing their functions at the NPA pending the outcome of their appeal of a ruling striking them off the roll of advocates. Jiba was accused of breaching this condition and recently visiting the NPA offices. On July 10, the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) overturned the ruling. Politics Hub
