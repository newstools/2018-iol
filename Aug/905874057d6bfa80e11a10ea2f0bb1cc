Cape Town - Convicted serial rapist Aviwe Hoya, who preyed on girls as young as 10 years old, has been handed five life sentences by the Western Cape High Court. The five rapes Hoya was convicted of took place between 2011 and 2012. Handing down judgment on Wednesday, Judge Kate Savage said Hoya had robbed his victims of their innocence and acted as a “one-man gang” with no regard for the lives of the young women he attacked. Hoya was arrested in the Eastern Cape in 2016 after DNA evidence linked him to the crimes. The rape victims were aged between 10 and 15 and were attacked while they were walking to or from school in Khayelitsha. One of Hoya's victims committed suicide while the other four are struggling with trust issues in their relationships with men. * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535.
