Freiburg - A 33-year-old Spanish national has been handed a 10-year prison sentence for the repeated rape of a boy who was sold for sex by his mother and her partner over a period of more than two years. Stefan Buergelin, the judge hearing the case in a court in Freiburg, found the man guilty on several counts of rape, child abuse and forced prostitution, and imposed a fine of 18 000 euros ($20 800) to be paid to the victim. The main suspect in the case, the mother's partner, confessed to the court in June that he was the "driving force" behind the crimes. The 39-year-old said the 100-page charge sheet was accurate, except for a few minor details. He had put pressure on his girlfriend to allow her son to be raped and abused by men they found online, he said. The man and the 48-year-old mother, who not only sold him for sex but also sexually abused him themselves, are expected to receive their verdict on Tuesday in a session beginning at 0730 GMT. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
