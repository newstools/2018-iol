* There is no substitute for hard work and passion. * As a woman it is important to learn how to defuse a situation and when to stand your ground. * Invest in relationships and consistently produce good work. * There are no quick routes - keep investing, especially in your intellectual capital. * Reading fiction is critical to help you better understand people. * Be engaged - know what is happening around you and surround yourself with different people. * Be patient - settle into the journey and unpack your bags, because there is a long road ahead of you. * Remember that life is unpredictable - if you don't face failure or adversity from time to time, then your dreams are not big enough or you are not trying hard enough to realise them. * One can never underestimate the value of support from family and friends and strong mentors - they are your best cheerleaders. * We can all do anything we set our minds to. The key is to surround ourselves with the right people and to be resilient. * Take pride and place effort in mentoring and uplifting other women.  - African Bank.
