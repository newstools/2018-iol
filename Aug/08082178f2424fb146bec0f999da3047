CAPE TOWN - OLX has launched a Women’s Month campaign called “Women In The Driving Seat” that focuses on different women doing good work in their different fields of expertise. OLX profiled 3 women known to the public for inspiring others through the great work they do in their communities. These Women included Hlengiwe Ntombela-Mthethwa; one of South Africa’s renowned gospel singers, ThickLeeyonce a model who is also known for her great photography work and Tshepi Vundla; a big player in the fashion and influencer industries. Diana Mjojo, Communications Manager at OLX South Africa said: “For us, this was a great way to show South Africa that we have some great women in our midst who are in the driving seats of their lives and careers. “Not only were we getting these inspirational women to tell their stories, but we were in a search for a woman that we can put in a driving seat as a company.” As part of the campaign, OLX was running a competition for one female to win a fully paid for driver’s licence package that includes study material, driving lessons, fees for booking a driving license test and learners license fees. “The compelling stories that came with each nomination via our Facebook page since the 9th  of August has made the process of choosing the most deserving candidate not something we take lightly. All the women of South Africa keep us motivated to continue providing economic freedom by making it easy to buy and sell almost anything on our app and website,” said Mjojo. The woman that’ll be put in the driving seat will be announced later this week after OLX has made their selection. Here are the interviews done with the 3 inspiring public figures: 1. Hlengiwe Ntombela-Mthethwa   2.  ThickLeeyonce   3. Tshepi Vundla   - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
