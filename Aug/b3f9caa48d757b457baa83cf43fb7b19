Los Angeles -Â At least seven people were killed when a large tractor-trailer blew a tyre, jumped a highway median into oncoming highway traffic and slammed into a Greyhound passenger bus, New Mexico State Police said. Images of Thursday's scene on US media show vast area of debris and a bus missing its front section up to the front tyres. The truck "suffered a tyre blowout, causing the semi to cross the median into opposing West-bound traffic" and collide with the bus carrying 48 passengers, New Mexico police said in a statement. The truck driver however survived the crash with "non-life-threatening injuries." The accident, near the New Mexico town of Thoreau, took place around noon (1800 GMT) and closed a portion of Interstate 40, a major East-West highway, local officials said. The bus was heading from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Phoenix, Arizona, local media reported. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. AFP
