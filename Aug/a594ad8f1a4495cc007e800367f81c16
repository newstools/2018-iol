CAPE TOWN - The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) will soon launch a new online booking platform for South Africans to get their driver’s license. First launched in the City of Tshwane, the system allows users to make an appointment to renew their driver's license and also offers a delivery service that will deliver you a new card to you through MDS Colliery. The RTMC said that waiting in long queues will soon be a thing of the past. According to RTMC, in just under 10 minutes users can book their learner’s or driver’s license tests, and driver’s license renewals on the platform. "The platform will ease the process of applying for vehicle driving licenses and combat corruption by minimising the manipulation of the process by unscrupulous officials”, said the RTMC in a statement. The RTMC said that the current process requires applicants to queue for between 140-180 minutes at a testing station. "This process is also fraught with corruption as officials at the licensing centres have an incentive to withhold available bookings for lucrative payments from willing applicants,” said the RTMC. They believe that this platform will promote efficient service delivery. “When it is launched later this month, the solution will benefit the public by removing barriers to access, eliminating fraud and corruption, and optimising business operations.” The system will first be available to people making their applications in Gauteng before it will gradually expand to other parts of the country. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
