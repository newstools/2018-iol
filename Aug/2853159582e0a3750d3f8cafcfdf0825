Cape Town - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema got tongues wagging after it was confirmed that he discharged a firearm at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane. The South African Police Service (SAPS) on Wednesday confirmed that a case of discharging of a firearm in a built-up area was registered, this after Malema was captured on video apparently discharging what appeared to look like an assault rifle at the stadium. The EFF was in East London in the Eastern Cape over the weekend where it celebrated its fifth birthday anniversary. The video shows the EFF singing and dancing on stage. However, during a song, Malema appears to fire several rounds from the rifle. EFF national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi reportedly dismissed the claims, saying that the gun seen in the video was a toy gun and therefore could not have fired real bullets.

What was the point of Julius Malema firing a "toy gun"? With so many political killings happening in the country, that was irresponsible of him. — Navy Seal (@navysealx)
