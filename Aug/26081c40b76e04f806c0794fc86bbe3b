Washington - Events to mark the anniversary of the deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, were largely peaceful, with police making just a handful of arrests. In Washington, D.C., thousands of people wanting to send a message that racism isn't welcome gathered Sunday outside the White House to protest a planned white supremacist rally in a nearby park. In the end, less than two dozen white nationalists showed up. In Charlottesville, the mother of the woman killed at last summer's rally visited the site of the attack, saying the country's racial wounds still have not healed.  Law enforcement officials faced blistering criticism last year for what was perceived as a passive response to the violence that unfolded. The anniversary weekend was marked by a much heavier police presence. AP
