Cape Town - Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma has revealed that top government officials deployed in the North West to fix the province have been threatened. Dlamini Zuma told the ad hoc committee in the National Council of Provinces on Thursday that they have discussed the threats with the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security (JCPS) cluster to provide security to the officials. But she promised that once they have established the identities of the people behind the threats they will report them to the police for prosecution. “Yes, there have been threats but that is not acceptable. If we knew, we would have gotten those people threatening. We have discussed this matter and we agreed that the JCPS cluster must provide security for the administrators and the officials that are threatened,” said Dlamini Zuma. The national government sent seven administrators to take over the running of several departments in the North West. However, some of the people in the province have not taken the intervention well. Dlamini Zuma said they discussed the threats with the law enforcement agencies and want action. “In terms of whether the intervention is accepted, I am still on record the intervention is accepted in the North West. But it does not mean there would not be tension,” she said. The North West has been under national administration since May this year when President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the intervention.
