Washington - Flight controllers on Earth have detected a small air leak on the International Space Station, NASA said on Thursday. The "minute pressure leak" was discovered on Wednesday night, eastern US time, by teams in Moscow and Houston, Texas. The controllers did not feel the leak represented a danger to the crew, who were sleeping at the time. The crew members were alerted to the problem after they awoke. The astronauts have determined that the leak appears to be on the Russian side of the orbital outpost.  "The leak has been identified and repair procedures are ongoing," the European Space Agency said. * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535. dpa
