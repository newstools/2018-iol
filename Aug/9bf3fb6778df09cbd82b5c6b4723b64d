CAPE TOWN - To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Big Mac, McDonald’s unveiled its own in-store limited edition currency the MacCoin. The coin is not digital, but rather a physical coin that can be collected. A collectible MacCoin will cost $3.99 (R52.57) or the equivalent of one Big Mac burger in the US. Customers can share, collect and redeem the coin for a free Big Mac at participating McDonald’s restaurants in more than 50 participating countries. “Since it was introduced at a family-owned McDonald’s restaurant 50 years ago, the Big Mac has traversed the globe and is enjoyed in cities from Shanghai to Chicago, providing delicious, feel-good moments to people all over the world,” said McDonald’s President and CEO Steve Easterbrook. “So we wanted a global celebration as unique as the burger itself. The MacCoin transcends currencies to commemorate our global iconic burger while giving customers all over the world a chance to enjoy a Big Mac on us", said Easterbrook. More than 6.2 million MacCoins will be distributed globally in more than 50 countries while supplies last. “When my great-grandfather Jim Delligatti invented the Big Mac at his grill in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, he just wanted to make his local customers happy,” said Nick Delligatti, fourth-generation McDonald’s owner-operator and great-grandson of Jim Delligatti, the inventor of the Big Mac. “August 2 would have been my great-grandfather’s 100th birthday, and I believe he would be very proud knowing his humble sandwich has made such a lasting impression that people all around the world can enjoy it wherever they find a McDonald’s", said Delligatti. There’s no mention if South Africa will be one of the 50 participating countries as the company does not state who those 50 countries are as yet. WATCH:   - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
