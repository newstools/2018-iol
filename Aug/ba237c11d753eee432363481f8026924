JOHANNESBURG – Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa did not receive congratulatory messages from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) at the just-ended summit in Namibia for his poll “victory” over opposition rival Nelson Chamisa. Chamisa’s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) is challenging the electoral results of the July 30 elections through the judiciary as he and his supporters claim massive fraud. In a communiqué released over the weekend, following SADC’s 38th Ordinary Summit of the Heads of State and Government held in Windhoek on Friday and Saturday, SADC ignored Mnangagwa’s victory despite congratulating Angolan President Joao Lourenco and his Movement for the Popular Liberation of Angola (MPLA) party’s recent electoral victory. However, SADC did urge all stakeholders in Zimbabwe to remain calm while the legal process regarding the outcome of the elections that are being considered by the courts continues. The summit also urged the international community to lift all sanctions against Zimbabwe, and support the country’s efforts for economic and social reform. African News Agency (ANA)
