When the original God of War game released more than a decade ago, it was certainly something special that left a lasting impression with many a gamer. Fast forward to 2018 and a new God of War game has been released, featuring series staple Kratos in an epic father and son adventure. This is God of War in a way we couldn’t have imagined it. The game features a compelling story with a much older, more mature Kratos; we get to see a side of him never seen before. Aside from Kratos and Atreus, the narrative is driven along by a host of great supporting characters. Gameplay now takes place from an over-the-shoulder perspective and this works incredibly well with Kratos’ new weapon, the Leviathan Axe. With its devastating light and heavy attacks that can be used to create combos, Kratos is able to throw and recall the axe, similar to Thor’s hammer, Mjölnir, from the Marvel movies. It’s a fantastic addition and makes the combat that much more satisfying. Visually, the game is stunning and runs quite smoothly even when playing on a launch PS4 console. There is the occasional frame rate hiccup, but this occurs fairly seldomly. The voice acting in the game is top notch, with special mention going to Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic for their portrayal of Kratos and Atreus, respectively. God of War is really something special and is going to be an incredibly strong contender for Game of the Year in 2018.   Buy God of War at www.loot.co.za
