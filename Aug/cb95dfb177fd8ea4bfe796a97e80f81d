JOHANNESBURG - The former chief executive of Grand Parade Investment (GPI), Tasneem Karriem, resigned on Friday as non-executive director of Spur Corporation, the company said. A qualified chartered accountant and a member of the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, Karriem had joined GPI in July 2015 to head up its corporate finance activities and was appointed group chief executive in July 2017. Karriem, who had resigned as chief executive of the Cape Town-based food and gaming firm in April, was GPI representative on the Spur board. In her place, Spur has appointed urban planner Prabashinee Moodley as a non-executive director and the GPI representative on the board with effect from August 15. "(Moodley) comes to the Spur Corporation board with a deep understanding of the food service industry and international business," Spur said. "Her expertise in the field of new market entry, existing market growth, and strategic franchise partnerships has significant promise for the further development of our business interests within the portfolio." - African News Agency (ANA)
