Johannesburg - Zimbabwe's estimated 14 million citizens were on Wednesday watching the Constitutional Court proceedings with baited breath as opposition leader Nelson Chamisa challenges the July 30 presidential election win of President-elect Emmerson Mnangagwa, hoping to overturn the poll results and possibly force a re-run. The proceedings are being broadcast live on ZBC TV and radio. Matters got off to a sticky start when Chamisa's South African legal team were initially denied entrance to the ConCourt by the country's justice minister on the basis that they had no work permits. Only following intense negotiations was the team permitted entrance, causing leading Advocate Thobani Mpofu to accuse the justice minister of a "travesty of justice". Court proceedings during the first several hours have been dragged out focusing onÂ discussion analysing the proceedings at the court with some critics accusing the court of debating peripheral issues instead of getting to the merits of the case. "Rivalled only by the trial of nationalist Daniel Madzimbamuto in 1965 that thrust the spotlight on Rhodesian leader Ian Smith's regime, opposition MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa's petition to have the results of last month's election nullified is a historical epoch of epic proportions with far-reaching ramifications for the country," reported Bulawayo 24 News.
