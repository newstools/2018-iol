Harare - Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa said he holds the opposition responsible for the bloodshed on the streets of the capital that saw three people killed. "We hold the opposition MDC alliance and its whole leadership responsible for this disturbance of national peace, which was meant to disrupt the electoral process," he told state broadcaster ZBC. Three people were killed in the protests, police told ZBC. "Equally, we hold the party and its leadership responsible for any loss of life, injury or damage of property that arise from these acts of political violence which they have aided and abetted," he said. Asked to comment on Mnangagwa's statement, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) alliance spokesman Nkululeko Sibanda told dpa: "[Nelson] Chamisa has not ordered any tanks on the street." Violence broke out when opposition supporters took to the streets of Harare claiming parliamentary elections results are rigged, despite the fact that no winner of the presidential vote has yet been declared. Security forces in armoured vehicles fired live rounds at the crowds. DPA
