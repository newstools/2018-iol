JOHANNESBURG -The  Energy Intensive User Group (EIUG) said on Wednesday it was extremely concerned about the continuing industrial conflict over wages at state-owned electricity utility Eskom. Eskom was forced to implement rotational loadshedding on Tuesday to deal with contraints brought on by wildcat strikes by employees which disrupted operations at some power plants. It warned of further cuts on Wednesday. EIUG, representing consumers who currently account for approximately 40 percent of electrical energy use in South Africa, said the economy could ill afford the ongoing strife at the power company. "Firstly, the economy needs the lights to stay on and secondly, the current conflict is not conducive to investment," EIUG CEO Xolani Mbanga said. Mbanga emphasised the importance of certainty and security of electricity supply not only for the larger consumers, but for all electricity users in the country. - African News Agency (ANA)
