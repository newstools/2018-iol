JOHANNESBURG - A black-owned jewellery manufacturing company based in Soweto - She Met Jewellery - which makes bracelets, earrings, pendants and necklaces is heading to Mozambique where it will showcase its products at the 54th Feira Internacional de Maputo (FACIM). South Africa will have a pavilion at the trade fair, which will be held in the capital, Maputo, from 27 August to 3 September Shermina Motlhasedi of She Met Jewellery said 22 other South African companies, assisted by the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) in order to be export ready, will showcase local products and services at the South African pavilion. “Mozambique as an emerging economy is a very attractive investment destination for us seeing that the South African jewellery market is currently very small and is experiencing a decline," said Motlhasedi. The dti makes it possible for small, medium and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs) to tap into the complex export market. - African News Agency (ANA)
