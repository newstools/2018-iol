Vereeniging - Gauteng police have launched a manhunt after a truck carrying liquor worth about R3 million was hijacked in Vereeniging earlier this week. The incident happened on Tuesday after the driver of the truck was stopped by a VW Golf GTI and BMW that were fitted with blue lights. "Six suspects accosted the driver and took him to one of the suspects' car before he was dropped off few kilometres away. "Police responded swiftly to the case of hijacking and the Sedibeng tracing team recovered the truck in the yard of one of the houses in Vereeniging where three suspects were arrested. Preliminary investigation led to the recovery of boxes of Jack Daniels whiskey that were already loaded in another truck."      The recovered whiskey was worth R3 million but, according to Masondo, three suspects had driven off with a second truck containing whiskey worth R1.5 million. Masondo confirmed that a manhunt has been launched for the remaining suspects and the missing cargo. The arrested suspects have since appeared at Johannesburg and Vereeniging magistrate's courts where they face charges of hijacking and possession of hijacked truck. IOL
