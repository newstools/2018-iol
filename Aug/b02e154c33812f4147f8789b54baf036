JOHANNESBURG – Popular Ugandan opposition activist and singer Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine, has been arraigned before the General Court Martial in Gulu and faces charges of unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. Wine is alleged to have played a role in Monday clashes during which President Yoweri Musiveni’s motorcade was vandalised and attacked by people throwing stones, according to a statement released by army spokesman Brigadier Richard Karemire. The Kyaddondo East Member of Parliament was arrested and badly beaten in Arua town, together with several opposition politicians, and was subsequently remanded until next Thursday, according to media reports. “As part of the investigations into acts of violence, the police arrested key organisers and participants including Hon Robert Ssentamu Kyagulanyi, the Member of Parliament for Kyadondo East Constituency,” said Karemire. “During the search of his hotel room by investigators, he was found possessing arms and ammunition which are ordinarily a monopoly of the defence forces,” Brigadier Karemire’s statement reads in part. “Consequently, Kyagulanyi has been arraigned before the General Court Martial in Gulu and charged under S 119 (1) (h) of the UPDF Act, 2005 on accounts of unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. He has subsequently been remanded till 23rd August 2018.” Sporting a badly swollen face Kyagulani was charged in the presence of only two of his lawyers and was unable to make a plea because of being in poor physical condition due to what his wife said was torture by the police.
