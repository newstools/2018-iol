Johannesburg â€“ An international Catholic organisation has contracted a private DNA agency in Kenya to conduct paternity DNA Services on children who believe they were sired by Catholic priests, in the latest sexual scandal to rock the Catholic church. Over the weekend, the agency - DNA Testing Services, formerly known as CSI Nairobi - launched a campaign asking mothers who have had children with priests to request for DNA tests, the Daily Nation reported on Monday. The move follows a number of cases of accusations in the East African country against Catholic priests by mothers, children and families of the clergy members siring children and then abandoning them, which in some cases has led to court action. One of the more severe cases involved a priest in Maua Meru who was accused by the family of murdering two cousins, aged 22 and 19, and later dumping their bodies in a river at Ruai. Their mother also later died in mysterious circumstances months after the murder of her sons, while priests refused to divulge any details of what happened. African News Agency (ANA)
