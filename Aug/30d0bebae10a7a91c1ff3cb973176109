Ekurhuleni - Opposition parties in Ekurhuleni have reacted with fury and threatened to rescind the appointment of controversial former SAPS officer Nkosana "Killer" Ximba as mayor Mzwandile Masina's security chief. Ximba was a close associate of the infamous former crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli, where both men faced murder charges for the alleged 1999 killing of Oupa Ramogibe; a former police officer stationed at the Vosloorus police station in Ekurhuleni. It emerged from a News24 report on Tuesday that Gugu Ndima, who is Masina's spokesperson, confirmed that the man notoriously known as "Killer" will be the security head honcho of Ekurhuleni's mayor. Phillip De Lange, the leader of the DA in the city's council, said he would write a letter to Masina on Wednesday asking him to explain the appointment and whether he couldn't find a more suitable candidate to head up his security detail. De Lange added that it would be unfair for taxpayers to pay the salary of a man the opposition leader said had "a questionable integrity". â€œAccording to legislation, he (Masina) is allowed to make political appointments and he can waiver certain qualifications if he so wishes. But he needs to come clear and tell us; was it a political appointment or not? "And if it was a political appointment, we are not convinced that he (Ximba) is suitably qualified for the job," De Lange said. He added that if the appointment was not rescinded by Masina, the DA would bring a motion in council for this to be done, or take the hiring on judicial review. Mampuru Mampuru, the EFF leader in council, also expressed anger over Ximba's appointment, saying he would engage the collective within the Ekurhuleni Red Berets, especially those in the community safety committee, to chart a way forward in challenging Ximba's appointment. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
