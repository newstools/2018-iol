JOHANNESBURG - A private company owned by Wits University has launched a new unit to focus on entrepreneurial development. The company, Wits Enterprise, said the new unit, called The Entrepreneurial Wayz (TEWZ), would focus on aligning business ecosystems, developing strategic partnerships, building entrepreneurial cultures and providing business support to contribute towards building an entrepreneurial economy. "TEWZ is a response to the country’s socio-economic challenges and the need to prepare young people for the 21st century global economy," it said. "By prioritizing entrepreneurial development, we contribute to building a robust entrepreneurial ecosystem and empowering young people and aspiring entrepreneurs to think beyond formal employment and start relevant, strong, sustainable businesses." TEWZ will provide insights, skills, tools and mentoring at every stage of the entrepreneurial journey, offering short courses, master classes, research, outreach projects, business incubators, design projects, business development support, advocacy and assistance with formalising strategic partnerships. The unit will work with students, entrepreneurs, non-governmental organisations, other public and private organizations and individuals. "We want to introduce programmes that address entrepreneurship at university level to equip our students with entrepreneurial skills," Wits University acting vice chancellor Tawana Kupe said. " Wits has various initiatives in place  toward becoming an entrepreneurial university where an entrepreneurial culture ensures that research ideas can be converted into solutions and graduates leave with experiences that allow them to contribute to the country’s development." - African News Agency (ANA)
