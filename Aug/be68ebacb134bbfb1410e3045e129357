Hip Hop artists including Slikour of Skwatta Kamp, JR, AKA and ProVerb all paid tributes to the "Number One Soweto Boy" - as he usually referred to himself - saying that he had inspired their music journeys and had always remained humble.                ProKid's numerous albums, including the 2005 debut "Heads and Tales", "Dankie San" in 2007, and Snakes & Ladders in 2009, earned him a numerous awards from the HYPE Awards and the Channel O Music Video Awards but he never managed to scoop a SAMA award. ProKid is survived by his parents, his wife Ayanda, his three-year-old daughter Nonkanyezi, his brothers and his extended family.
