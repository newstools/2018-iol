Johannesburg - Police found no explosive device at the Mall of Africa after the shopping centre's management received a bomb threat earlier, a spokesman said on Wednesday. "Police searched and nothing was found and it was handed to the management," said police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini. The mall's management confirmed in a statement that trading had resumed at the shopping complex. Shoppers were evacuated from the Mall of Africa, one of South Africa's largest shopping complexes, on Wednesday as police searched for a bomb after receiving a threat. The mall, located between Johannesburg and Pretoria, houses about 300 shops, including global brands such as Inditex’s Zara, Hennes & Mauritz (H&M), Cotton On, Starbucks and Woolworths. "There was a bomb scare and we received a complaint and police went there to search the building," Dlamini said earlier. Opened in April 2016, the mall mainly attracts the rising number of young consumers in Africa's most developed economy, which has thrived on demand for commodities. In a separate incident, the management of Sandton City, a mall in the financial district of Sandton in Johannesburg, said it too had received a bomb threat. No explosive device was found after a search and shopping had resumed. Reuters
