NEW YORK - Aretha Franklin passed away at her home in Detroit after a long battle with pancreatic cancer last Thursday. And while the Queen Of Soul had been struggling with health for some time, the iconic star did not leave behind a will, according to reports from TMZ. The Respect singer's estate is estimated to be worth around an $80 million (R1.1 billion), according to People. Without a will, Aretha's assets were deemed "intestate". The recording artist's estate will be split evenly between her four children, in accordance with Michigan state law. The absence of a will is interesting in light of Aretha's wealth and circumstances. Aretha's eldest son Clarence has special needs, requiring both financial and other support. Without a will, no specific plans are detailed for the eldest of Franklin's children. Franklin passed away at her Detroit, Michigan home surrounded by friends and family August 16, following years of declining health. The star was a musical powerhouse throughout her near six-decades in the spotlight. During her 76 years, she earned 18 Grammy Awards and sold more than 75 million records worldwide. - DAILY MAIL
