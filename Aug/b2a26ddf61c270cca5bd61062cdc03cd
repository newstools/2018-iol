Johannesburg - Visa processing operation services for Ukraine have been substantially expanded across the African continent, the world’s largest outsourcing and technology service specialist for governments and diplomatic missions worldwide, VFS Global, announced. VFS Global Regional Group COO Jiten Vyas this week said the expansion of his company’s global network of visa processing operations for the government of Ukraine had grown from the eight to 34 countries. The expansion includes locations in Algeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, South Africa, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo. “Applicants can now visit the centrally located Ukraine Visa Application Centres to enjoy a seamless application experience within a secure environment,” said Vyas. “In South Africa, two new Ukraine Visa Application Centres have been opened in the cities of Pretoria and Cape Town for the convenience of applicants. The Ukraine Visa Application Centres in Ghana and Senegal are located in the Joint Visa Application Centre facility in cities of Accra and Dakar.” Vyas said the new operations across Africa were among the fastest global rollouts for his company - as many as 26 new countries in just more than two months. The newly launched Ukraine Visa Application Centres offer applicants a host of services such as SMS tracking of visa application, dedicated website for information, email assistance along with photocopying and photobooth services at most locations.
