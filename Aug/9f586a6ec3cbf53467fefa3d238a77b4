Comments by the US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Friday suggested a slower pace of monetary tightening, putting pressure on the dollar. At 5pm, the rand bid at R14.1336 cents to the dollar, 12cents firmer than at the same time on Friday. “It’s mainly due to the slide in the dollar. I don’t believe it’s any local factors,” said Treasury One dealer, Andre Botha. Powell said on Friday the US central bank was sticking with its strategy of gradual rate hikes to protect economic growth. “It’s a better time for emerging markets,” said Afrifocus Securities derivatives trader, Cheslyn Francis. He said emerging markets have attracted inflows despite the ongoing trade war between the US and China.
