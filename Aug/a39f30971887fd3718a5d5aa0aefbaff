New York - The New York Times reports that Italian actress Asia Argento recently settled a complaint filed against her by a young actor and musician who said she sexually assaulted him when he was 17. Argento is one of the most prominent activists of the #MeToo movement. The Times says that Argento, 42, settled the notice of intent to sue by Jimmy Bennett, who is now 22, for $380,000 shortly after she said last October that movie mogul Harvey Weinstein raped her. Bennett says in the notice that he had sex with Argento in a California hotel in 2013. The age of consent in California is 18. The Times says it received court documents that have been authenticated by three people familiar with the case. Representatives for Argento could not be immediately reached for comment. Bennett declined to comment to the Times. AP
