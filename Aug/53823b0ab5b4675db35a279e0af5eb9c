JOHANNESBURG - Exxaro Resources said on Thursday half-year profit rose 8 percent boosted by a strong performance in its core coal business. Diluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) rose to 953 cents for the six-month period ended 30 June 2018, from 882 cents in the same period last year. HEPS is the main profit gauge in South Africa and strips out certain one-off items. Exxaro said net operating profit at its coal segment rose 12 percent to R3.387 billion. -REUTERS
