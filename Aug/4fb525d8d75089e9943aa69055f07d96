JOHANNESBURG - City Power has warned that water supply to certain parts of Gauteng and North West may be affected after the Eikenhof substation caught fire on Monday. The 88/11Kv substation located adjacent to Rand Water Board in Eikenhof, south of Johannesburg, caught fire around lunchtime on Monday, resulting in power outages in areas and businesses that include Naturena, Kibler Park, Eikenhof, South Fork, Lougherin, Alveda, Rand Water, Joburg Water, and the Johannesburg Prison. City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena said that the water supply might be affected due to Rand Water being fed solely from this substation. "City Power technicians are on site with emergency medical services team. Assessments will be conducted after the side has been declared safe," Mangena said. Mangena said City Power would continue to provide updates as and when new information becomes available, and apologized for the inconvenience caused to the affected customers. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
