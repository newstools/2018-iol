INTERNATIONAL - Niantic, the creators of Pokemon Go have announced that they will be adding improved parental control options to the game. The company said that it added a new Niantic Kids log-in platform that will let parents better manage their children’s privacy in the augmented-reality app. The new portal gives parents the option to review and approve their kids’ in-app permissions before they start playing, and offers better control over what personal information gets shared in the game. The Niantic Kids platform was built in conjunction with SuperAwesome’s Kids Web Services, a company that develops tools for making kid-friendly apps and websites. Recently, the company announced that it would be adding more social features that would allow direct player-to-player interaction in the near future, so it is now very important for them to keep younger players safe. Parental Controls allow you to restrict access to numerous functions on your child's Nintendo system, including communication with other players, viewable content and purchases on Nintendo eShop. Niantic said: "The experience has been developed in conjunction with SuperAwesome’s Kids Web Services, a service certified by ESRB Privacy Certified and by the kidSAFE Seal Program. Niantic Kids gives you peace of mind that your child’s information remains secure while they have fun playing" - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
