Goma - Fourteen bodies were found in the north-eastern city of Beni in Congo, five days after suspected rebels kidnapped 15 people, officials said on Tuesday. "The death toll has reached 14 bodies," the spokesman for the mayor of Beni, Zachee Mathina, told dpa, indicating that now all 15 people abducted during an attack on the town on Thursday had been found dead. Last week, another body had already been found in a remote area of Beni, according to Mathina. The rebels attacked Beni on Thursday and kidnapped 15 people after they had been pushed back by the army. The Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan rebel group that has operated in the region since 1995, are believed to be behind the attack and kidnapping. The group is responsible for the deaths of more than 1,500 people and 800 kidnappings since 2014, according to local civil society organizations. Beni lies west of the Virunga National Park and the Rwenzori Mountains, close to the Uganda border. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. dpa
