Cape Town - Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has agreed to resign as mayor of Cape Town, DA leader Mmusi Maimane confirmed on Sunday. The DA leader confirmed this at a press briefing held with De Lille. "Patricia de Lille has agreed to resign the office of Mayor, effective October 31, 2018. "This is an opportunity for the City of Cape Town DA caucus to take stock, to regroup and to unite. The process to elect a new mayor will begin immediately, with more details available in due course." Maimane added that: "The DA has taken a decision to withdraw all internal disciplinary charges against Patricia de Lille. "Any other investigations by the City are not covered by this agreement." This comes hours after Independent Media reliably learned that De Lille was expected to resign as part of a deal stuck with the DA in July. De Lille will remain a member of the party. IOL
