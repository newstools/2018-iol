JOHANNESBURG - The United Democratic Movement (UDM) has welcomed more than 200 people in KwaZulu-Natal from other political parties, the party said on Monday. The UDM said the new members left parties such as the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), African National Congress (ANC), and the National Freedom Front (NFP) andÂ hailed from districts such as Amajuba, eThekwini, iLembe, kwaMhlabayalingana, Mzinyathi, and Uthukela. ''As we welcome these like-minded individuals into the fold, we remind South Africans that political emancipation does not mean we have stopped in our quest for enduring freedom,'' the UDM said in a statement. ''The UDM has for 21 years worked towards uniting South Africans from all communities in a political home for all, built on the foundation of the principles and ideals of our national Constitution. To this end, we aim to address poverty and imbalances in our society, inspired by our unifying love of our country and its people.'' The UDM is led by Bantu Holomisa. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. African News Agency (ANA)
