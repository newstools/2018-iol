JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in the Free State region served Harmony Phakisa mines with a 48-hour strike notice to Harmony mines, the union said on Thursday. Thousands of NUM members are ready to strike. Regional Chairperson, Tanki Malefane said they were fed up and angered by an ongoing conduct by Harmony in that they are busy doing away with all our agreements, and replacing them with company policies. “All our attempts to engage peacefully with Harmony failed and therefore left us with no option but to strike,” said Malefane. “The matter was referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and the NUM was awarded a certificate of non-resolution to the dispute which allowed it to go on strike starting with a night shift on Sunday." - African News Agency (ANA)
