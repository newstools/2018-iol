Johannesburg – Zambian opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema may face contempt charges after he accused several constitutional court judges of being corrupt, in addition to slamming the judiciary while in South Africa last year. Chief Justice Ireen Mambilima received a letter from Henry Chilombo, a resident of Lufwanyama in Zambia’s Copperbelt Province, asking her to investigate the comments made by United Party for National Development leader Hichilema, the Lusaka Times reported on Thursday. The opposition leader made his inflammatory comments towards the end of last year while addressing the media at his residence in New Kasama, accusing Constitutional Court Judges Mungeni Mulenga, Palan Mulonda and Annie Sitali of being corrupt. Chilombo’s letter, copied to the director of public prosecution, said Hichilema was also wrong to accuse the judiciary of corruption and being under the control of President Edgar Lungu during a visit to South Africa. Currently, Bishop John Mambo and Gregory Chifire, the CEO of Committee of Citizens, have been summoned by the Supreme Court to answer contempt charges laid against them for letters written to the Chief Justice and media statements attacking the court judges.
