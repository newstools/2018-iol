JOHANNESBURG - Emboldened by a new peace deal, civil war-torn South Sudan, with Africaâ€™s third-largest oil reserves, will resume oil production in northern Unity State next month to make up for more than $4 billion of revenue lost during years of fighting, AP has reported. The renewed drilling will be the first since the fields were destroyed when the conflict began in late 2013. - African News Agency (ANA)
