Johannesburg - Former National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Mxolisi Nxasana says he no longer has the golden handshake money he has been ordered to repay by the Constitutional Court. Nxasana was ordered to repay the amount after a Constitutional Court judgment delivered on Monday said Zuma had abused his power in negotiating for Nxasana's departure. It said the manner in which Nxasana left office was illegal as well as the R17 million golden handshake he received. After tax, the amount was reduced to R10 million. It was unconstitutional for Shaun Abrahams to be appointed as NDPP, the court also ruled. Nxasana in an interview with eNCA, confirmed he no longer had the money as he had "to earn a living". "I don't have it... I had to live, I had to earn a living my brother. I had liabilities. Remember when the money came, I didn't steal it, it was paid into my account and I wasn't working and had liabilities I had to see." Questioned on how he intends repaying the money, Nxasana said since the ruling did not indicate where or who he had to pay the money to, he'd wait for an indication on this and negotiate repayment. Speaking of his feelings towards former president Jacob Zuma, who Nxasana said he regarded as a father, the former NPA boss said he still respected him but was disappointed by his actions. "I still respect him as a father but I was very disappointed at what he did to me... not only to myself because this affected my family a great deal. "I am where I am today being a victim of all the circumstances because of him because he allowed himself to be threatened or intimidated by people who had their own agendas." IOL
