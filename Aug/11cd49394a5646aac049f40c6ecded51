CAPE TOWN - Google’s Undo Send feature on the web version of Gmail that has been saving people from embarrassing typos since 2015, will now be available on Android. According to a report by Android Police, Google will start with a release on the official Android version of Gmail that will arrive with the Gmail version 8.7. It works by implementing a time delay on sent emails to let you rescind them within 10 seconds if you happened to impulsively send it out with an error in plain sight. It exists already on mobile within Google’s Inbox app on both iOS and Android. However, users that are official Gmail mobile clients, have not seen the feature. Android Police notes that this may be a server-side update, so it may not be showing up properly in update notes for all devices and may require a restart of Gmail even if the app is already running version 8.7. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
