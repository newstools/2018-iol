In early trade the domestic currency reversed some of Wednesday’s losses following a brief spike to R13.37 to the dollar after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the ANC would back the expropriation of land without compensation vote. Corporate treasury manager at Peregrine Treasury Solutions, Bianca Botes, said although many argued that this was merely a political ploy to gain the upper hand over the EFF, the potential implication for financial markets, food production and economic growth could not be denied as uncertainty once again hovered over the economy. “We will keep a close eye on the political developments locally as the land debate continues nationwide,” said Botes. At 5pm the rand bid 20cents weaker than Wednesday’s same time bid at R13.40 to the greenback. Against the pound, the rand was 15c weaker at R17.46 and to the euro the currency eased 16c to R15.56. Investec chief economist Annabel Bishop said with the more hawkish tilt in the FOMC’s tone currently pricing into the market, the rand on a near-term basis could move towards R13.50 to the dollar. “Indeed in the remainder of this year’s third quarter the risk of depreciation towards R14 a dollar remains. Volatility will likely persist,” Bishop said. TreasuryOne senior currency dealer Andre Botha said politics was still the primary local driver of the rand and would most likely continue to be as we head into next year’s elections.
