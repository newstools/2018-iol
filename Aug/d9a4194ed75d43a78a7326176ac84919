Johannesburg - Gauteng police on Thursday confirmed an investigation into the manhandling of a woman by police at the Jeppe Police Station. The incident reportedly happened on Wednesday night at the station and in one video circulating online, a woman lying on a set of chairs is seen being forcibly being removed by police officers and another citizen. In the second video, another officer is seen briefly intervening in the matter before his colleague again grabs her by the arm and dragging her on the station's floor. It's alleged the woman was protesting poor service at the time of the incident.      Gauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters confirmed the incident, adding that SAPS management condemned it in the "strongest terms".      She confirmed that Gauteng provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange has since authorised a probe into the matter. "It is totally unacceptable that a member of the public, more so a woman, should be illtreated in such a manner. It is also appalling that a woman is manhandled by the very people who are supposed to be prioritising her safety,"Â  De Lange is quoted as saying. IOL
