JOHANNESBURG - Absa said on Wednesday that more than 10,000 customers have registered for the ChatBanking on WhatsApp service, with 300,000 messages already sent, since the bank launched it three weeks ago. Absa ChatBanking on WhatsApp is an automated messaging system which allows users to perform banking on the chat platform they prefer, using conversational language and short cut commands. It is one of the many recent breakthroughs in banking technology which enables customers to conduct banking using the chatting app. Arrie Rautenbach, chief executive of Absa Retail and Business Banking, said that ChatBanking on WhatsApp was a secure, private and fully integrated service. "Our aspiration is to be an entrepreneurial, digitally-led African banking group that makes a real and lasting contribution to the financial wellbeing of our customers and the societies where we operate," Rautenbach said. "ChatBanking on WhatsApp will enable cost-effective, safe and easy digital interactions, and offer more accessible and efficient engagement with our customers through a secure interface. We have seen a great take-up on this platform amongst early adopters, specifically for airtime and data purchases."  The launch of ChatBanking on WhatsApp coincided with the unveiling of Absa's new visual identity as the group separates from Barclays PLC to form a standalone African bank with global scalability. Jacques Barkhuizen, chief information officer of virtual channels at Absa Retail and Business Banking said that it took Absa two years to develop ChatBanking on WhatsApp. The service was developed in partnership with Facebook and Clickatell, a leading company in global mobile messaging - African News Agency (ANA)
