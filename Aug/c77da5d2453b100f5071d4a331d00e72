Monster Hunter: World is the first game in the series to be released on the current gen consoles and also the most recent Western release on console since Monster Hunter Tri on the Nintendo Wii. What it sets out to do is bring Monster Hunter back to the West while making it more accessible for a broader audience. Monster Hunter: World does this and it does it in spades. The story follows your hunter and the Fifth Fleet in an expedition to the New World in attempt to learn more about the Elder Crossing, which is the migration of Elder Dragons to the New World. The story itself isn’t the deepest but it’s interesting enough to motivate you to go hunting monsters. A bunch of the characters are quite eccentric too as the game showcases its Japanese influences. Gameplay is the best part about Monster Hunter: World. You start off with the most basic equipment, but as you progress and go on more hunts, you’re able to craft better armour and devastating weaponry. Herein lies the game’s biggest addictive feature: gathering resources and crafting better gear. The best part about this is that there are so many gear options and 14 different weapon types to choose from, each with their own extensive upgrade tree. It’s incredibly satisfying and rewarding with knowing and feeling your weapon becoming essential to survival.   Monster Hunter: World is one the most pleasantly surprising experiences of 2018 and will have you hooked once you dive in. Buy Monster Hunter: World at www.loot.co.za
