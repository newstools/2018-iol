JOHANNESBURG â€“ The case to force platinum miner Lonmin to honour its social and labour plan commitments is set for a hearing at the high court in Mafikeng on October 26, the Mining Forum of South Africa said yesterday. The forum has initiated legal action against the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR), Lonmin and other parties to enforce the company's compliance with its social plans towards local economic development, housing, procurement, community skills development and human resources development programmes. This comes after a DMR inspection last year had found that Lonmin had neglected its social responsibilities. The forum took issue with Lonmin being allowed to continue its operations, therefore it took the legal route against the DMR and parties. The failure by the government to hold Lonmin accountable was a serious compromise and also an insult to the people of South Africa, and in particular the people of Marikana, the mining forum's president Blessings Ramoba said yesterday. - BUSINESS REPORT
