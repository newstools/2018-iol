Police Minister Bheki Cele, through his spokesperson, Reneilwe Serero, declined to clarify Mahumapelo’s allocation of VIP protection. The concern came after the DA in the North West lodged a complaint with the public protector’s office to investigate the matter. But Cele was adamant. “Mr Mahumapelo has followed due processes in terms of VIP protection services” Serero said on Saturday. On Thursday, the DA wrote to the public protector’s office in the North West complaining about Mahumapelo’s continued use of state vehicles and 24-hour personal security for him. DA North West leader Joe McGluwa wrote to Sechele Keebine of the public protector’s office, asking it to investigate. McGluwa wrote a similar letter to North West speaker Susanna Dantjie, asking her to table the outcome of her findings to the legislature. “Mahumapelo is no longer entitled to the use of official vehicles or VIP protection. Those benefits should have been withdrawn the day he tendered his resignation. He is the chairperson of the ANC in the province and is not in service of the people," he said. Weekend Argus
