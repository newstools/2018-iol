CAPE TOWN  - Trade union Solidarity announced that it had accepted Eskom’s offer of a wage increase of 7.5 percent for this year, a 7 percent increase for years two and three with a guaranteed increase equal to the CPI on housing. A once-off cash payment of R10 000 after taxes has also been added to the deal. This comes after the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said on Thursday it had signed a three-year wage agreement with state-owned power utility Eskom, applicable from July this year to June 2021. According to Deon Reyneke, Deputy General Secretary at Solidarity, the trade union also confirmed that Eskom would act decisively against all those who, during the negotiations, have made themselves guilty of unlawful behaviour that falls outside of Eskom's code of conduct. Unions and Eskom agreed that the review of the company's current short-term incentive scheme would be referred for further engagement at the Central Consultative Forum.
