Johannesburg â€“ The British and Kenyan authorities are to work together to track down British paedophiles. The UK plans to build a cyber centre in Nairobi to help Kenyan police stop child abuse images being shared online. British prime minister Theresa May was expected to make the announcement shortly following her arrival in Kenya on Thursday, the first British PM to visit the East African country since Margaret Thatcher visited in 1988, the BBC reported. It will also assist efforts to identify potential victims and access data from tech firms to catch offenders. The planned cyber project will be linked to Kenya's existing anti-human trafficking and child protection unit, which was set up in 2016 with input from the UK's National Crime Agency. The UK will also offer support to Kenyan police in dealing with violence against girls and women, plus legal expertise on pursuing complex terror and organised crime cases. African News Agency (ANA)
