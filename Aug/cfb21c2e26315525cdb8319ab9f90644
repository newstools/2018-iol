JOHANNESBURG - Opposition legislator Tendai Biti of the MDC Alliance has been detained at Harare Central Police Station, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) said on Thursday. In a short statement, the ZLHR said it had managed to track down Biti and finally located him at CID Law and Order Section at Harare Central Police Station. A team of ZLHR lawyers is currently representing Biti who was handed over to Zimbabwean authorities by neighbouring Zambia after the lawyer fled there in the wake of the result of the Zimbabwe general election. Biti was handed over despite a court order saying he should stay in Zambia until a determination has been made regarding his refugee status. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
