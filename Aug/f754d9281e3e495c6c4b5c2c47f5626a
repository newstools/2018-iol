Johannesburg - The assault cases against PowerFM boss Given Mkhari and his wife Ipeleng have been withdrawn, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) confirmed on Friday. This comes weeks after the NPA confirmed it would continue prosecuting the couple on assault charges they had laid against each other following a domestic dispute at their home. This despite their announcement that they had withdrawn the charges against each other and would resolve the matter privately. "We confirm that an unfortunate incident happened between us in our home on Saturday, July 14, 2018. "We both individually reported the matter to the police. We are now withdrawing each case to resolve the matter in the privacy of our home," the couple said at the time. NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane has now confirmed that both matters have been withdrawn at the Randburg Magistrates' court. "This after the senior public prosecutor of Randburg called both parties to participate in the mediation process and thereafter took a decision to withdraw both matters," she said.  IOL
