JOHANNESBURG - Kenya's upcoming mining forum in November will focus on how the industry can contribute to the government’s Big Four agenda, given that it provides raw materials for at least three of the four pillars which include manufacturing, universal healthcare, affordable housing and food security, organisers said on Thursday. The conference will be hosted by the Kenya Chamber of Mines, which represents the interests of investors in the mineral development value chain, in collaboration with Spintelligent, which has organised similar events elsewhere in Africa. "Kenya remains an exciting new mining destination on the continent” Chamber of Mines chief executive Moses Njiru Njeru said. The country was ready to embrace technology and innovations to leapfrog the entire mining value chain towards becoming a modern mining player, with an extensive airborne survey already underway to identify mineral opportunities, he said. "The Kenyan leadership has also ensured that corporate social responsibility is part and parcel of the growth of the industry and has ensured that local residents benefit," he added. An expo will run concurrently with the forum, with more than 40 suppliers showcasing the latest local and international solutions and services for mining operations. The event will bring together an estimated 600 delegates from more than 40 mining companies from around 20 countries. - African News Agency (ANA)
