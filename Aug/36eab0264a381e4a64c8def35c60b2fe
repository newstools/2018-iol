Many were created by the late Brian Deonarain and his son, Desmond. The City Hall was originally made by Deonarain in 1982, but when it needed restoration in 2011, after years of exposure to the elements, it was Desmond who revamped it. The original postcard on the left was photographed not long after Minitown opened. The harbour, rail network and the sugar terminal (top right corner) can all be seen. The recent photograph shows the same scene today. Seated on the wall is Craig Chappell and his two children, Joel and Emma-Rose. Originally from Durban, Chappell now lives in Hong Kong. While on holiday in Durban, he brought his children to see the models that he himself had so loved as a boy. The Independent on Saturday appeals to readers who have old pictures of Durban and other parts of the province to send them to us for consideration. If any readers are featured in the old picture, we will do our best to recreate the scene with them in it again. Readers who send pictures digitally - images should be about 1MB - can address them, with the relevant information, to satmail@inl.co.za If the pictures are in hard copy format, they can be posted to The Editor, Old Pictures, The Independent on Saturday, PO Box 47549, Greyville, 4023.
