INTERNATIONAL - Facebook is redesigning the navigation on its mobile app to focus on the apps that users pay more attention to. According to a report by CNET, this update, everyone will still see the News Feed, notification, and menu icons, but the other slots will be replaced with icons for what you use the most. Additionally, an alert will be sent when these new shortcuts will be added. The report states that the new navigation bar will feature four to six of your most frequently used services and if they can’t be found there, they will still be accessible under the menu icon. “We want the shortcuts available in the navigation bar to reflect how an individual uses Facebook,” product manager Alexa Andrzejewski said in a statement to CNET. “To that end, we’re customizing mobile shortcuts so everyone can more easily connect with their most frequently used products.” The bar’s redesign will be available worldwide over the next few weeks Andrzejewski told CNET.
