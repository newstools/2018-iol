Johannesburg - Former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas is one of the first witnesses that will appear at the start of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on Monday. Other witnesses include; former GCIS head Themba Maseko, former minister Vytjie Mentor, Phumla Williams from GCIS and Treasury official Ndleleni Willie Mathebula. The long-awaited state capture inquiry starts on Monday. The commission, which is headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, said there were other witnesses which will be called to testify but consulting processes were still underway. The inquiry was appointed by former president Jacob Zuma in January, a year after the release of State Capture report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela.  Madonsela's report had recommended that the inquiry be appointed to probe allegations of state capture involving the notorious Gupta family, government officials and state-owned enterprises.  Madonsela had stated Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng should be the one to appoint the chair of the inquiry, but Zuma had taken legal action against this recommendation, stating that he was the one who was legally mandated to appoint an inquiry and its chair. The inquiry was recently granted a two-year extension, from the original 180 days, for competition. Investigators assigned to the commission will continue with their work while the commission is underway.  The commission will be held in public, but in case of special circumstances, witnesses will be allowed to testify in private.  "The proceedings are not those of a court of law. This is not a litigation, it is an inquiry into allegations," said Zondo in July. Zondo will open proceedings on Monday, while Advocate Pretorius SC will give a statement on behalf of the legal team and Advocate Thandi Norman SC will present the reports. IOL
