CAPE TOWN - Instagram announced that you will now be able to send polls through direct messages on the social platform. How it works It works the same as adding the poll sticker to your stories, but now, you’ll be presented with the option to send the story to your own selection of users. Everyone in the group chat will be able to view the poll results as they vote in real time. It’s not as groundbreaking of an update but it’s still a useful tool for when you just want to poll a small group of relevant people, like a dinner party or family members. When the company announced the feature on Twitter, its users showed that it wasn't relavent and that the company should consider features such as multiple choice polling or longer video duration.

  August 14, 2018        The poll sticker has been available for Stories since last October, and since then, it has been joined by the Emoji slider and the Questions sticker. Like many of Instagram’s new features, the update will first be available to select group of users on Android and iOS and then in the next few weeks will be available to the rest of the world.
