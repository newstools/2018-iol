Durban - Hundreds of guests arrived at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre (ICC) to round off IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's 90th birthday celebrations with a gala dinner on Friday. Buthelezi's family planned a series of events to celebrate the Zulu prince's milestone birthday. Last week a thanksgiving service was held in Durban and on Monday, the day Buthelezi turned 90, the event was celebrated in Ulundi. Buthelezi, who will lead the IFP into next year's elections, told his audience in Ulundi that he wanted to apologise to those he may have hurt and asked for forgiveness.
