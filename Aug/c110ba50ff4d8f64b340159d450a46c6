CAPE TOWN - Uber has partnered with a Woolworths Franchisee in Johannesburg to allow grocery delivery to residents in the Sandton suburbs of Edenburg, Bryanston and Conrad Drive. Uber Eats general manager for South Africa, Ailyssa Pretorius, said the partnership was only made with this one franchisee and not the Woolworths group. "The franchisee saw the benefits that Uber Eats could enable through another franchisee he owned and identified a gap in the marketplace offering, where at the time, there was no option for convenient goods," said Pretorius. Consumers can order a wide selection of food and household items such as toilet paper, bin bags, flowers and braai briquettes. "Uber Eats always aims to innovate and evolve the food delivery industry and these type of partnerships have enabled them to do just that," said  Pretorius. However, when ordering items on the platform the price is adjusted by 7.5 percent. On the platform, a warning is shown giving a reason that the increase will ensure "quick and convenient delivery". Uber’s food delivery service Uber Eats recently expanded to more than 100 cities in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. For the first time, the service will launch in places such as Ireland, Egypt, Kenya, Ukraine, Romania, and the Czech Republic, along with previously announced markets around the globe, a spokesperson confirmed. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
