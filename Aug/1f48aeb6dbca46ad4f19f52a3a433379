Johannesburg - Liberation icon Zondeni Veronica Sobukwe, 91, has died, the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) said on Wednesday. The PAC said the widow of its party founder, Robert Sobukwe, passed away in the early hours after a long illness. "It is with great sadness that we wake up at the saddest news, we have lost one icon of the liberation, Mma Veronica Sobukwe," said the PAC in a statement. Sobukwe had been at the Midland Hospital in Graaff-Reinet in the Eastern Cape for three weeks. Her discharge from the hospital had been delayed because she could not get her medication on time after a mix-up at the in-house chemist. Sunday Independent and African News Agency/ANA
