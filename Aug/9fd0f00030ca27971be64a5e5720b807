HARARE ‑ Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa has on Thursday, reached out to his MDC Alliance opponent Nelson Chamisa regarding the prevailing tense situation in the country. “We have been in communication with Nelson Chamisa to discuss how to immediately diffuse the situation, and we must maintain this dialogue in order to protect the peace we hold dear,” he said on his official Twitter account. “It is also more important than ever that we are united, and commit to settling our differences peacefully and respectfully, and within the confines of the law.” Mnangagwa, who Wednesday night, blamed Chamisa of inciting demonstrations which led to four deaths, seemed to be having a change of heart. Thursday morning, he said there was need for him and the opposition leader to lead by example and show all Zimbabweans that peace was paramount. “This land is home to all of us, and we will sink or swim together,” said Mnangagwa, who succeeded long-ruling and heavy-handed former president Robert Mugabe. The ruling Zanu-PF presidential candidate mourned the victims of military attacks on civilians. "I wish to extend my sincere condolences to the families of the victims of yesterday’s violence. All human life is sacred, and their deaths are a tragedy, irrespective of the circumstances,” he said. Mnangagwa also wished a speedy recovery to all those injured in clashes, adding what was important now was moving “beyond yesterday’s tragic events, and to move forward together". Violent protests broke out in Harare on Wednesday, as suspected opposition MDC Alliance supporters said they were defending their votes against electoral fraud. Government responded by deploying the police, and eventually the military, as protesters went on a rampage, burning vehicles and destroying properties. African News Agency (ANA)
