JOHANNESBURG - Women in the media industry have an opportunity to be part of the 2018 media management skills programme supported by the Fibre, Processing and Manufacturing (FP&M) Seta, the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) said on Wednesday. ''The FP&M discretionary grant announced this week will support Sanef's efforts to increase the presence of women leaders in the media in South Africa through, among others, online training, a Wits University media management certificate and targeted training," Sanef executive director Kate Skinner said in a statement. "The programme aims to address some of the industry’s most critical challenges, including increasing diversity in terms of race and gender of media leaders by providing quality skills training for modern media environments.” Alumni of the programme include Move magazine editor Zenoyise John, The Herald and Weekend Post editor Nwabisa Makunga and Isolezwe editor Slindile Khanyile. The programme is delivered by well known media trainers, Frayintermedia. The programme consists of an online media management foundation short course, a Wits University media management certificate block course in Johannesburg, career and professional development coaching and access to a network of industry leaders. "FP&M’s support has been invaluable in helping us build a cadre of women with the skills to lead in the media industry. The format for training also allows us to build a real network of practitioners who not only have the skills to lead but the skills to lead in an ever-changing environment,” said Frayintermedia managing director, Paula Fray. The first run of the online course will begin 1 September 2018. The closing date for applications is 30 August. African News Agency (ANA)
