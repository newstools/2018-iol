CAPE TOWN - Microsoft announced in a blog post that it would be adding automated transcription capabilities to OneDrive for Business for video and audio files. The software maker is using the same AI that is available in Microsoft Stream, which is a corporate video-sharing service to make OneDrive smarter. Later this year, OneDrive for Business will be able to generate a transcript of a video or audio file, which is particularly useful if you’re holding meetings or presenting and want to provide a transcript. This new transcription service will also mean that files are a lot more searchable in OneDrive. Videos, photos, and audio files will all be searchable for the content that is within them, making it easy to find when someone mentions a particular phrase in a meeting or finding receipts for expense reports. "We are unlocking the value of photos and images stored in OneDrive and SharePoint. Using native, secure AI, we determine where photos were taken, recognise objects, and extract text in photos," said Omar Shahine, partner director of programme management for OneDrive and SharePoint. However, Microsoft does not say when OneDrive will include these features other than “later this year”. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
