Rome - Italian authorities have removed the vehicles abandoned on the surviving part of Genoa's collapsed Morandi bridge, including a green truck that managed to stop just before plunging into the void. The vehicles were removed late on Thursday. On Friday, local media Genovaquotidiana.com published video of the operation, showing the 45-meter-high edge of the collapsed road section. Rescue workers worked for the third night in a row to look for at least 10 missing persons under the rubble of the bridge, which gave way shortly before noon (1000 GMT) on Tuesday. The search is focusing around the ruins of a pillar that collapsed on the left bank of the Polvecera creek, and on a stretch of road that fell over rail tracks, the ANSA news agency said. Public funerals were scheduled at 11:30am Saturday for the victims, in the presence of Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Genoa Archibishop Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco. But according to the La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX newspapers, relatives of 17 of the 38 confirmed dead have refused to take part because they are angry with authorities for the accident. The bridge was managed by private motorway company Autostrade per l'Italia, which the Italian government is holding responsible for the tragedy. Autostrade, controlled by the Benetton family, which also own the United Colours of Benetton fashion label, insists that the bridge was under constant surveillance and did not appear to be at risk. However, La Repubblica daily reported that a technical study commissioned by the company in 2017 found suspected weaknesses in the bridge's concrete-encased stay cables. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. dpa
