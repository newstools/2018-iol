Johannesburg - Zimbabwe's ailing opposition MDC-T leader President Morgan Tsvangirai on Wednesday appointed one of his deputies, 40-year-old Nelson Chamisa, as acting party president. "President Morgan Tsvangirai has with effect from today, 7 February 2018, affirmed Vice President Hon. Nelson Chamisa as the acting president of the party by operation of the constitution until the President’s return," said Tsvagirai's spokesperson, Luke Tamborinyoka in a Facebook post. The announcement comes amid reports of jostling for leadership of the party among the three MDC-T vice presidents who include Thokozani Khupe and Elias Mudzuri. However, Tamborinyoka said Chamisa's appointment was in "light of the president’s absence and that of the two other vice Presidents who are both in South Africa. VP Chamisa also continues in his assigned duties as the acting chairperson of the MDC Alliance". Tsvangirai is in South Africa, where he is receiving treatment for colon cancer. In his latest communique he has dismissed rumours that he was in a critical condition and instead said he was recovering. Zimbabweans head for the polls in the next few months. African News Agency/ANA
