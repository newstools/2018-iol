CAPE TOWN - The South African Table Grape Industry (SATI) said on Monday that the
country’s harvest would be stable in the 2017/2018 season despite the drought. “The country’s
harvest is resilient with volumes stabilising despite the worst drought in
decades,” SATI said in a statement. “The 4th Crop Estimate for the 2017/18
table grape season shows the upper and lower limits about 16,8% and 12,2%
lower, respectively than the previous record 2016/2017 season.” It said that the new
estimate was between 56,2 million and 59,3 million cartons, reflecting an unchanged
upper limit and a slight increase in the lower limit. -- African News Agency
