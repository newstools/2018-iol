Berlin - AÂ man accused of killing a pensioner and hiding his
dismembered corpse in a deep freezer for 10 years unexpectedly broke
his silence on Friday to deny murder. Almost four months into the trial at the regional court in Berlin,
the 56-year-old defendant said the 80-year-old widower was dead when
he found him in the pensioner's apartment in late December 2006. Then the thought came to him to conceal the death of his elderly
acquaintance and collect his pension, the defendant said. He admitted
to dismembering the body. The prosecution says that the defendant won the widower's trust,
before shooting him and then going to great lengths to conceal his
death. Police entered the apartment and found the dismembered corpse in
early January 2017. dpa
