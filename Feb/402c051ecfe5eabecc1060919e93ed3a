 London - A drug dealer who used the dark web to supply customers with a drug 25 times stronger than heroin was jailed for eight years on Monday. Kyle Enos, 25, sold the synthetic opioid fentanyl to 168 people in the UK, where four died, as well as Europe and the US between May 2016 and May 2017. Enos sold it on the dark web – a hidden part of the internet used by criminals, hackers and drug gangs. Fentanyl is so potent that police wore bio-hazard suits when they searched his home in Newport, South Wales, and arrested him in May 2017. They found 25 000 doses of the painkiller, which was linked to the death of the US singer Prince in April 2016. Enos imported it from illegal sellers in China, bragging: ‘I sell seriously strong, potent drugs.’ At Cardiff Crown Court, he admitted importing, supplying and exporting the drug. Nicholas Gareth Jones, prosecuting, said: ‘No cases as serious as this have been reported involving fentanyl.’  Daily Mail
