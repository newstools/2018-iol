Mashonga says getting the company to where it is now was not easy. There were many challenges, especially as this field is male dominated.

They have learnt to trust me to deliver quality security products that give them peace of mind."

She says her company has provided sophisticated electronic solutions for clients such as Absa Bank, insurance services firm Hollard, Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa), the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, the University of the Western Cape, and Western Cape College of Nursing.
