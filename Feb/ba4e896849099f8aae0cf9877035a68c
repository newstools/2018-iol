CAPE TOWN - Twitter exploded yesterday when users discovered that MultiChoice did not have the Football league cup (Carabo Cup), final which saw Manchester City compete against Arsenal, on their TV schedule. The league cup match which took place last night at London’s Wembley Stadium saw Man city walk away with the winning title after a 3-0 win. However, as supporters geared up to watch the game on satellite service, DSTV, they were confronted by a rude awakening when they learnt that DSTV's Supersport did not broadcast the league cup final. DSTV users then stormed to Twitter to voice their rants and grave disappointment.  Some Twitter users even went as far as calling Twitter better than DSTV while others questioned why they were paying an exorbitant monthly fee for an ‘unreliable’ service. When frustrated Twitter users asked why DSTV was not streaming the football match, Super Sport responded via a Tweet, saying "unfortunately, we have not had the rights to the Carabao Cup this season".
