Stuttgart - An 18-year-old woman suffered serious burns when
someone at a carnival celebration in the south-western German town of
Eppingen threw her into a witches' cauldron at the weekend. The woman landed up to her knees in hot water during the incident on
Saturday. Her legs were badly scalded and she was taken to a
specialist clinic for treatment, a police spokesman told dpa on
Monday. Police said they were investigating six people for causing serious
bodily harm and failure to assist a person in danger. They do not yet
know who threw her into the cauldron. The cauldron full of scalding hot water was bubbling away over an
open fire on a cart that was being pulled by several people. They did
not stop to help her after the incident, the police spokesman said. Police said they would also look into whether the open fire should
have been permitted in the first place. Some 2 000 revellers had dressed as witches for an annual "witches'
procession" organized by a local club as part of the regional Fasnet
carnival tradition. Dating back to the 13th century, Fasnet focuses on witches and devils
in elaborate costumes, often with ghoulish, hand-carved wooden masks. Eppingen's witches' club, Hexenzunft Eppingen, has been organizing
its own annual processions since 2003. "This sort of thing just should not happen," Eppingen mayor Klaus
Holaschke told the newspaper. The municipal authorities would start
their own investigation on Monday, he added. dpa
