Nairobi â€” A Kenyan judge has rescinded the orders used to deport to Canada an opposition politician over his alleged role in a mock inauguration by opposition leader Raila Odinga. Judge Luka Kimaru has also ordered Kenya's government to return the passport confiscated from Miguna Miguna when he was deported. Miguna was at Odinga's side when he took an oath as the "people's president" last month in a protest against President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election. The government responded by arresting opposition politicians and shutting down TV stations broadcasting the event.
