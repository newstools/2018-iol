London - Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams is set to be replaced by
his deputy, Mary Lou McDonald, on Saturday after nearly 35 years at
the head of the Irish republican party. The 69-year-old veteran of his party's struggle to end the partition
of Ireland announced in November that he planned to hand over power
at a special meeting of members. "Leadership means knowing when it is time for change and that time is
now," Adams said as he made the announcement. McDonald, 48, has urged Sinn Fein members to help her "build a new
Ireland." "Uniting this island is the best outcome for all our citizens and it
is now our task to convince our unionist friends and neighbours of
that and to encourage them to help us build a new Ireland," she said
as she accepted the party's nomination to succeed Adams. Speaking last month, Adams said his decision to step down was "part
of Sinn Fein's 10-year plan for the regeneration and renewal of the
party." He warned that sectarian politics in Northern Ireland had again
become "very polarized at this time and the atmosphere is very
toxic." dpa
