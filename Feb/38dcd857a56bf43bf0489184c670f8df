Johannesburg - As rumours continue to swirl on an imminent Cabinet reshuffle by President Cyril Ramaphosa, social media hilariously chipped in on who would face the axe and should return. Earlier, reports emerged that Ramaphosa was expected to appoint a new Cabinet soon, with speculation rife he will get rid of the ministers implicated in state capture allegations. The cabinet reshuffle has been in the making for several weeks now after the ANC moved to axe former president Jacob Zuma. In a list that was circulating on social media on Thursday, with official parliamentary letterheads, it appears Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba will be fired and a new minister will deliver the Budget Speech on Wednesday.
