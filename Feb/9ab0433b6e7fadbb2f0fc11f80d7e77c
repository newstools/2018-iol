Brockton, MassachusettsÂ - Police say a Massachusetts woman stabbed her two young children to death and then asked a neighbour to call 911, in what prosecutors call a "heartbreaking crime." Authorities discovered the children's bodies Monday in a Brockton apartment. Police say the brothers, ages 5 and 8, were killed sometime over the weekend. Their mother, 43-year-old Latarsha Sanders, is scheduled to be arraigned on two counts of murder Tuesday in Brockton. It could not immediately be determined if she has a lawyer to comment on the accusations. Prosecutors say she has a third child who is safe. Authorities have not publicly identified the children. Plymouth District Attorney Timothy Cruz says an investigation into the woman's motive is ongoing. AP
