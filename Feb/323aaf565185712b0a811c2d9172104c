London - Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle on Monday
revealed further details of their May 19 wedding, including that the
celebrations will include a carriage procession through the streets
of Windsor. The wedding service in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle will begin
at midday and the couple will be married by Archbishop of Canterbury
Justin Welby, Kensington Palace said in an update. At 1pm the couple will set off on a carriage procession. "They hope this short journey will provide an opportunity for more
people to come together around Windsor and to enjoy the atmosphere of
this special day," the palace said. The newlyweds will then join guests from the congregation at a
reception at St George's Hall. Later that evening, Harry's father,
Prince Charles, will host another reception for the couple and their
close friends and family. The day coincides with the FA Cup final, at which Harry's brother
Prince William usually presents the trophy as president of the
Football Association. While kick-off is expected to take place at 5:30pm, William would
have to leave the festivities for at least two hours if he wants to
keep his usual appointment at Wembley Stadium, around 20 kilometres
away. Last month, William said his brother had not yet asked him to be best
man, as widely expected, and said he was "still working" on a way to
deal with the date clash. dpa
