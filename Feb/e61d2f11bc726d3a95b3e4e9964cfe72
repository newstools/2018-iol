JOHANNESBURG - The national airline of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) - Congo Airways - on Wednesday announced that it will launch new flights between South Africa and Congo with immediate effect. The flights from Kinshasa to Johannesburg will run three times a week, on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, on the two-year old airline which was launched in October 2016. The new DRC-South Africa service represents Congo Airway's first scheduled flight to South Africa, affording an opportunity to further strengthen relationships, build new economic partnerships, and enhance trade and tourism business between the two countries. Congo Airways plans to launch flights to Cameroon, Angola and Dubai next. The airline is jointly owned by the DRC government and investors from the private sector. The airline has an ambitious plan to operate a low-cost model, which will see it adding to its fleet of aircraft to service more destinations outside the DRC. Congo Airways chief executive, Desire Balazire Bantu, said that it was a "proud achievement" for them to have their first international flight to South Africa as the DRC. The launch of Congo Airway's DRC-SA route follows the two country’s adherence to the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) which was launched last month on the margins of the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
