Durban - An Umhlanga woman was hijacked, pistol whipped and taken on a high-speed joy ride before thieves made off with a bag full of cash on Wednesday. Kyle van Reenen, marketing manager at Marshall Security, said shortly after 11am the company was informed of a hijacking in Lighthouse Road in Umhlanga Rocks. Reports from the scene alleged that a female driver was stationary on the popular road, she was approached by two male suspects armed with handguns. The men ordered her into the back seat of her vehicle before assaulting her with the butt of a firearm and driving the vehicle at high speed towards Durban.  Armed reaction officers were dispatched to the M4, where the vehicle was found abandoned, having suffered a blowout. It had come to a stop on the embankment next to the road. The victim was found on the scene severely traumatized. Van Reenen said it is believed the suspects fled into the nearby bushes after the crash, taking a bag containing a large amount of money. South African Police Services and Metro Police K9 units undertook an extensive search of the area but the suspects managed to evade arrest.  The victim was assessed on scene by Crisis Medical Emergency Medical Services, but refused further hospital treatment. The Independent on Saturday
