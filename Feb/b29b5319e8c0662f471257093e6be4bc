New York - Vanessa Trump, the wife of
Donald Trump Jr., and two other people were taken to a hospital
on Monday after she opened a piece of mail containing an
unidentified white powder that was later determined not to be
hazardous, New York officials said. "The substance had arrived by mail and it was addressed to
Donald Trump Jr.," said New York Police Department spokesman
Carlos Nieves. Vanessa Trump was hospitalized after she complained of
nausea following her exposure, New York officials said. Three patients from the household were transported to the
NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center for further
evaluation, said Fire Department spokeswoman Sophia Kim. The three included Vanessa Trump's mother, though she had
not complained of symptoms, the police spokesman said. US authorities have been on alert for mail with white
powder in it since 2001, when envelopes laced with anthrax were
sent to media outlets and U.S. lawmakers, killing five people. Donald Trump Jr, the eldest son of US President Donald
Trump, has been in the public eye for his role in 2016 meetings
with a Russian attorney and others where the Trump campaign was
offered potentially damaging information about Democratic rival
Hillary Clinton. Reuters
