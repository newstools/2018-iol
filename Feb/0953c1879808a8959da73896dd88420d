Maphumulo - An off-duty police captain has been shot dead during an armed robbery at a shopping centre in Maphumulo in Northern KwaZulu-Natal, police said on Saturday. At 4.10pm on Friday afternoon, an unknown number of suspects entered a hardware shop and robbed the employees of an undisclosed amount of cash before proceeding to a nearby supermarket where they entered through the back entrance, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said. "Upon entering, the suspects saw the police officer, who was off-duty at the time, inside the supermarket. [The] suspects shot and [wounded] him, then they fled using their getaway vehicle."
