Buenos Aires, Argentina - Ballet dancers have taken to the streets of Argentina's capital with an open-air performance to protest government funding cuts. About 80 dancers, choreographers, and other workers of the state-funded National Ballet of the Dance lost their jobs in December under government austerity measures. Thursday's protesters performed pirouettes to "Swan Lake," blocking traffic but causing onlookers to break into cheers and applause. President Mauricio Macri came into office in 2015 promising to cut bloated spending and revive Argentina's struggling economy. He has tried to reduce the high fiscal deficit by slashing subsidies to utilities, ordering layoffs and reducing spending on some social and cultural programs. But the measures have stoked labour unrest. AP
