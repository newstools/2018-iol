Nairobi - A prominent American investigator
of the illegal ivory and rhino horn trade has been found dead in
his Nairobi home with a stab wound in his neck, media reported. Esmond Bradley-Martin, 75, had spent decades tracking the
movement of animal products, mostly from Africa to markets in
Asia. "It's a very big loss for conservation," said Paula Kahumbu,
chief executive of Wildlife Direct, an organisation focused on
protecting elephants in Kenya. He had been about to publish a report exposing how the ivory
trade had shifted from China to neighbouring countries, Kahumbu
added. The former UN special envoy for rhino conservation was
found in his home on Sunday afternoon, friends said. Bradley-Martin's research was instrumental in China's
decision to ban its legal rhino horn trade in 1993. It also
pressured China to end legal ivory sales, a ban that came into
force on January 1. "His work revealed the scale of the problem and made it
impossible for the Chinese government to ignore," said Kahumbu. He was an expert on the prices of ivory and rhino horn,
leading undercover investigations into markets in China and
Southeast Asia. He is the second prominent conservationist to die in East
Africa in the past year. South African Wayne Lotter, whose work
targeted ivory smuggling from Africa to Asia, was shot dead in
Tanzania in August. There was no immediate comment from police. Reuters
