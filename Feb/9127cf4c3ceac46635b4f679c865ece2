 London - Former Dynasty star Heather Locklear has been arrested after she allegedly bit her boyfriend’s nose in a drunken rage and then attacked three police officers. Locklear, who played Sammy Jo Carrington in the 1980s US soap, fought with Chris Heisser, a childhood sweetheart she began dating again last year, at her home in Thousand Oaks, California, late on Sunday night. A police source said the 56-year-old actress ‘practically bit the tip off of Heisser’s nose’ then attacked officers when they tried to put her in handcuffs. In front of her daughter Ava, 20, a ranting Locklear kicked one policeman in the groin and punched another and their female colleague. She was charged with domestic violence and assaulting police. Heisser, an ex-convict, was arrested less than an hour later for drink-driving. Both were released on bail yesterday morning to await court hearings. Daily Mail
