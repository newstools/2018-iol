Kuala Lumpur - Famous rapper Namewee has been detained for his
latest "obscene" Lunar New Year music video, the Malaysian
authorities said in a statement released late Thursday night. In the music video, all the performers were seen wearing dog masks
and some mimicked certain sexual positions. Police said in the statement that the controversial Namewee, who's
real name is Wee Meng Cheng, received complaints from ministers plus
four other public complaints as the video is deemed sensitive in the
Muslim-majority nation. Muslims make up 60% of the nation's population; dogs are
considered taboo to some within the community. The music video titled "Like a Dog", depicts Wee, a Malaysian of
Chinese ethnicity, sitting outside the prime minister's office in the
government capital Putrajaya on a chair with background dancers. Wee will be investigated for the second time, following a similar
case two years ago over another controversial music video of his
called "Oh my God." According to the police statement, Wee is said to have "insulted
Islam," which might take away the "racial unity and harmony" of the
nation. In a Facebook post earlier on Thursday, Wee posted a picture of
himself outside the federal police headquarters in Kuala
Lumpur saying: "I am not afraid because I believe Malaysia has
justice." In a Youtube video uploaded five days ago, the 34-year-old defended
the controversial music clip saying it is purely for entertainment
with no intention to disrespect any religion in particular. If found guilty, Wee faces a year in prison. DPA
