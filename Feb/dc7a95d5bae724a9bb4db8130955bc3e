Johannesburg - While the country awaits the news of when President Jacob Zuma will step down, his wife Thobeka Madiba says "Kusazoshuba" (It's about to get real). Madiba who is active on Instagram made the comments on her account @firstladyzuma, where she posted a picture of her and Zuma on what seems to be like a private jet. "My everyday crush, Nxamalala Msholozi Maphumephethe Inkunzi Emidwayidwa Zinyane likaMnyakanya. Kusazoshuba ungalwi nomuntu engalwi nawe💝🎀 #southafrica#biggerthanmattersofthestomach 🤞" ((Praising Zuma) Things are about to be serious, don't fight with the person who is not fighting against you.)  My everyday crush, Nxamalala Msholozi Maphumephethe Inkunzi Emidwayidwa Zinyane likaMnyakanya. Kusazoshuba ungalwi nomuntu engalwi nawe💝🎀 #southafrica #biggerthanmattersofthestomach 🤞 A post shared by  TMZF Founder & Patron (@firstladytzuma) on Feb 9, 2018 at 2:41am PST  In a reply to a user @sekgakam, who asked "Kusazoshuba, really?" Madiba said her husband didn't join the African National Congress in 1991. "@sekgalam kusazoshipha ukotshi darling. UMsholozi did not join the ANC in 1991, jumped ship nor hip hopped between the struggle and wealth accumulation. He left his home at a tender age to fight apartheid. He was prepared to pay the ultimate price. He will finish what he started because he does not take orders beyond the Atlantic Ocean#mattersofthestomach 💚💛🖤 " Amidst mounting speculation over the future of President Zuma, following the postponement of SONA, and the postponement of an ANC NEC meeting, ANC President Ramaphosa called on South Africans to be patient.
In a statement, released by new ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe, Ramaphosa acknowledged that he and Zuma had discussions on Tuesday night about “the transition and matters relating to his position as the President of the Republic”. “The discussions were constructive and lay the basis for a speedy resolution of the matter in the interests of the country and its people.” On Thursday, Ramaphosa told the party's Parliament caucus that immunity from prosecution for President Zuma was not part of the "transition" discussions. He also told the MPs that the talks would be concluded in a "day or two". On Friday morning, the ANC issued a statement stating that the ANC's Top six will no longer participate in the build up towards the #Mandela100 Rally planned for Sunday. "This is because of various other commitments they are required to attend to." "The mobilisation programme will however proceed with a number of NEC members deployed in and around Cape Town today. The Rally on Sunday, 11th February 2018 will also proceed as planned and shall be addressed by the President of the ANC, Comrade Cyril Ramaphosa, at 15:00," said the statement. The Star
