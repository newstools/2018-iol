Johannesburg – The Rwanda Media Commission (RMC) is to investigate a Rwandan preacher next week after he called women the source of all evil in a radio sermon, the BBC reported. Seventh Day Adventist preacher Nicolas Niyibikora told listeners "women are out of God's favour" during the broadcast on Amazing Grace radio in January, warning "there is nothing good you can find in women". "If you've read the Bible, who brought the sin into the world?" he asked listeners, adding: "It was not a man." Rwanda’s New Times reported that his comments have provoked a storm of anger with Pro-Femme Twese Hamwe holding a press conference warning such words “can bring hatred and conflicts among Rwandans if nothing is urgently done about it”. RMC executive secretary Emmanuel Mugisha said the radio station is going to have to explain itself. However, Niyibikora was expelled from the Seventh Day Adventists in Rwanda five years ago and the church has subsequently made efforts to distance itself from the controversial preacher.
