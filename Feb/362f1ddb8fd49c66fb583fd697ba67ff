CAPE TOWN - South Africa's mining industry should speed up transformation in the sector to let more black players in, or face pressure from the population, deputy mineral resources minister Godfrey Oliphant warned on Thursday. "The message to the mining industry is that ... the time for transformation in a meaningful way is actually now," Oliphant said on the last day of the industry's annual "mining indaba" in Cape Town.
