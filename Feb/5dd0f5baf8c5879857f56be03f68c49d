NEW YORK - A single tweet from US reality TV star Kylie Jenner
about Snapchat on Thursday triggered a massive plunge in the
messaging applications's stock price.    Jenner, tweeted: "sooo does anyone
else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so
sad." Wall Street panicked in response to the "Snapchat Queen's" message,
andÂ Snapchat shares slipped almost 8% at one point, totalling
around $1.7 billion dollars (R19 billion) in value. They closed down 6%. Jenner later tweeted again: "still love you tho snap ... my first
love." Nevertheless, Snapchat boss Evan Spiegel may have had the last laugh,
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission declaring on Thursday
that his pay for last year was an enormous $638 million,
mostly due to his shares in the app, which was listed last year. A recent redesign of the application's platform, which distinguished
between conversations with friends and professionally produced
content, had proven to be unpopular with many users.
