Cape Town - Muizenberg police on Monday appealed for help tracking down two suspects linked to the attack on a party of hikers at St James Peak, in Kalk Bay, last month. In January, reports emerged that nine hikers were attacked and robbed of their possessions while hiking in St James Peak. Shortly after, a hiker was stabbed to death near Boyes Drive in St James while hiking with his partner. The second incident led to the deployment of additional resources on the mountain side above Kalk Bay.
