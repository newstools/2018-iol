Washington - US President Donald Trump says on Twitter that
armed teachers protecting schools from would-be shooters should "have
annual training" and "get [a] yearly bonus." Trump first made the concealed-carry proposal in the wake of a school
shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 people dead last week.                dpa
