New Delhi - Tamil superstar Kamal Haasan on Wednesday announced
he was joining politics and launched his political front before tens
of thousands of cheering supporters. Haasan, 63, who has starred in hundreds of films, is lovingly called
Ulaga Nayagan or "hero of the world" by his fans. He has said he will work towards becoming a chief minister of the
Tamil Nadu state and fight corruption and communalism in the region.
State elections are due in 2021. "My party's name is Makkal Needhi Maiam [People's Justice Centre in
Tamil]," Haasan said after unfurling the party flag at the gathering
in Madurai, the state's political capital. Haasan, who has spoken against Hindu right-wing politics in India,
said his party would follow centrist, liberal politics, according to
broadcaster NDTV that translated the actor-turned-politician's speech
from Tamil. Haasan enters politics two months after another top Tamil star
Rajinikanth announced his political foray. The entry of the two film stars onto the scene has livened up
regional politics in Tamil Nadu, which has seen political uncertainty
in the recent months. Several film stars have dominated politics in India's southern
states. This is particularly the case in Tamil Nadu where three film-
stars have served as chief ministers. dpa
