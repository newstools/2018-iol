Geneva - North Korea must abandon its
nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and allow peace to take
root on the divided peninsula, South Korea's foreign minister
said on Monday. Kang Kyung-wha, foreign minister of the Republic of Korea,
also called for the resumption of visits between separated
Korean families, as a "humanitarian and human rights issue",
especially are many are in their 80s. "It is imperative to ensure the Pyeongchang spirit lives
long after so peace can take root on the Korean peninsula," Kang
told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. "North Korea must
heed the call and abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile
programmes." Reuters
