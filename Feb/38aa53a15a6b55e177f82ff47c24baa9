Islamabad - Pakistan has banned events
promoting Valentine's Day, and media coverage of any such
events, for the second year in a row after a court ruled the
holiday un-Islamic. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra)
issued an advisory on Wednesday warning television and radio
stations against any Valentine's Day events. "No event shall be held at the official level or at any
public place," Pemra said. The ban was introduced by Islamabad High Court last year
after a petition by a citizen who said the holiday was a
cultural import from the West and "against the teachings of
Islam". Many of the Muslim-majority nation's young people - more
than 60 percent of the population is under age 30 - and
commercial establishments have in recent years embraced
Valentine's Day traditions of hearts, flowers and chocolates. But the country of 208 million has also seen a new wave of
ultra-religious political activism that sparked a backlash
against such visible, and some say immoral, celebrations. Hard-right political parties including the Taliban-linked
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam parties have in recent years held rallies
to denounce the holiday. Valentine's Day falls on February 14. Reuters
