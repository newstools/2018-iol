Manila - Rights groups on Monday slammed Philippine President
Rodrigo Duterte for encouraging violence against women when he said
soldiers should shoot female rebels in their genitals. Duterte made the remarks last Wednesday during a meeting with more
than 200 former communist rebels who have surrendered, including 48
women. In his speech, Duterte talked about female fighters and said that
soldiers should "shoot their vaginas" because "without that, they are
useless." Read more: Shoot female rebels in their vaginas, Duterte tells soldiers Representative Emmi De Jesus of the Gabriela Women's Party said the
remarks only confirm that Duterte is "the most dangerous
macho-fascist in the government right now." "He is dangerously pushing the fascist armed forces of the
Philippines to commit more bloody human rights violations and grave
abuses of international humanitarian law," she said. "He has further presented himself as the epitome of misogyny and
fascism terribly rolled into one," she added. New York-based Human Rights Watch noted it was not the first time
that Duterte has made "misogynist, derogatory and demeaning
statements" about women. "It encourages state forces to commit sexual violence during armed
conflict, which is a violation of international humanitarian law," it
said. Last month, Duterte came under fire for saying he would offer 42
virgins to attract tourists to visit the country. In May last year, he told soldiers he would protect them against
criminal charges even if they rape three women while implementing
martial law in the southern region of Mindanao. dpa
