CAPE TOWN - SA’s Labour Minister, Mildred Oliphant, will deliver an address during the opening and closure of the Jobs Summit at Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand later this week. Held under the theme: “United we can create jobs” - the Jobs Summit on 4 and 5 October 2018 was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa in his 2018 State of the Nation Address. The president highlighted that jobs, especially for the youth, will be at the centre of the 2018 national agenda. The Jobs Summit comes on the back of rising unemployment. Statistics South Africa second quarter data showed that unemployment had increased to 27,2 percent. The Jobs Summit will bring together government, business, labour, and community organisations to advance job creation. It will provide a platform for open discussion on the challenges faced by each social partner in the creation of jobs. The conference will also have commissions to discuss various themes in which Director-Generals in the Economic Sectors, Employment and Infrastructure Department (ESEID) cluster will participate together with representatives from business, labour and community organisations. The themes will focus on: Enabling interventions/interventions supportive of employment creation, sectoral interventions creating employment, and interventions focused on enhancing efficiencies. The gathering will culminate with the signing of an agreement on the way forward and an anti-corruption pledge. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
