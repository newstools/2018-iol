JOHANNESBURG – Eskom's group executive for generation, Thava Govender, on Monday tendered his resignation after assuming the position only in March this year, the power utility's spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said. Govender, who was also acting group executive of risk and sustainability, has worked for Eskom for 27 years. During that time, Govender served in various capacities including as group executive of transmission and customer services and as the divisional executive of generation division. Phasiwe said that Eskom chief executive, Phakamani Hadebe, has wished Govender well in his new endeavours. Top executives appear to be leaving the cash-strapped power supplier as Johnny Dladla also resigned last week as chief executive of Eskom Rotek Industries, an Eskom subsidiary which provides construction, maintenance and transportation services in support of the power utility's operations.
