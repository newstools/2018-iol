Pretoria - The five men accused of murdering actor and football player Dumisani Masilela briefly appeared in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria on Monday. Their case was postponed to October 11 to enable Legal Aid South Africa to provide them with a lawyer. The five accused as it appeared on the indictment are: Bongani John Masombuka, 34, of Tembisa, Sfundo Harrison Nkosi, 30, of Ivory Park, Khumbuzo Solomon Mukhuba, 27, of Ivory Park, Brian Makhubedu, 24, of Ivory Park and Mashudu Malema, 31, also of Ivory Park. Masilela, 29, a Rhythm City actor, was gunned down during a hijacking in August last year. He was shot in Tembisa by the occupants of a black Jeep. Masilela managed to drive himself to hospitalÂ where he received surgery. He, however, died later that day. His alleged killers are facing 11 charges ranging from murder to robbery and kidnapping. The charges against them relate to other cases as well. Masilela is claimed to have been only one of a series of victims who were allegedly targeted by the accused. More than 70 witnesses in total are expected to testify in the trial.  zelda.venter@inl.co.za
