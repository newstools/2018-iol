CAPE TOWN – Nintendo is planning to release a new version of the Switch console in 2019. this is according to a report by The Wall Street Journal, which states that the updated hardware is said to be planned for the second half of 2019 and could come as soon as summer. The report continues to say that the console will receive an improved LCD screen. However,  WSJ’s report doesn’t mention any other new features or upgrades. Recently, Nintendo had just launched its online service allowing gamers the following: 1. Ability to chat with friends via the Switch Online app, 2. Back up your precious game saves to the cloud (though there are a few caveats), and 3. Play a growing collection of retro NES games online or with a pal locally. Those games require an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription if you want to keep playing; they’ll be inaccessible if your membership ends. According to Nintendo in the next financial year, the company expects to sell 20 million units in the year ending March 2019. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
