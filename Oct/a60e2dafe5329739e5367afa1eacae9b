The dark-haired divorcee did not want to reveal her name because she had children. She attended the trial for the past few months and was mistaken as a family member because she always hugged and kissed him when he entered and left the dock. But she revealed to the Pretoria News on Wednesday that she was his girlfriend. “I met him when I took someone to prison to visit a friend. He came to join us at the visitors' section. Our eyes locked. It was instant love for both of us. I immediately saw his heartache.” The woman said she did not know he was the Springs Monster during their first visit. “I was a bit shy, but I went to visit him again a week later - this time alone. I asked him why he was in jail and that I could see his anguish. I told him to be honest with me. “He then told me everything. I was not shocked because I could see his good heart. I told him it was not really him who did all those things to his children. It was the drugs. “He became emotional and asked me how I knew this. I told him I knew all about being hurt and that I could see right through him. “Since then he joked with me that he did not want to look at me because I immediately knew what he was thinking.” She said he told her he missed his five children. “He cried and said he wished he could see them again. He just wanted to stand in front of them and say to them that he was sorry and how much he loved them.” The woman said the father was livid with his former wife because “she was the one who had introduced him to drugs”. “It was her who made him that ugly person. I will always stand by him, no matter what. I made a promise to him and God that I will walk the road with him in jail until the day I take his hand and we walk home together.” The feeling is clearly mutual. The man, said to be a sadist, smiled at her as he entered the dock seconds before hearing his fate. She handed him a cold drink. He smiled and said, “Thank you baby. Love you”. Pretoria News
