JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) stalwart Andrew Mlangeni has been admitted to hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, his family said on Wednesday. The stalwart's son, Sello Mlangeni, said his father was unwell but was in a stable condition. ''Our beloved father Andrew Mlangeni was admitted to hospital in Cape Town on Wednesday afternoon. The struggle stalwart and former member of Parliament has been in and out of hospital in the past two weeks due to ill health. Doctors are describing his condition as unwell but stable. His family is by his bedside in Cape Town,'' Sello said in a statement. Mlangeni has been in hospital since Friday. Mlangeni, 93, is one of the only two surviving Rivonia trialists. The other surviving political activist is 85-year-old Denis Goldberg, with whom he stood trial along with Nelson Mandela, Ahmed Kathrada, Govan Mbeki and Raymond Mhlaba, among others. He was among eleven anti-apartheid activists who were arrested on 11 July 1963 at Lilliesleaf Farm, Rivonia, north of Johannesburg and was sentenced to life in prison at Robben Island. In June, the ANC joined Mlangeni and his family as he celebrated his 93rd birthday in Johannesburg. President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed guests at the bash. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. Additional reporting by ANA
