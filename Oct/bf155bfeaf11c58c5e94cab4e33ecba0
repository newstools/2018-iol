INTERNATIONAL – Samsung’s mobile head, DJ Koh, has given users a first glimpse of what the company’s foldable phone is all about. In an interview with CNET, the executive said that while unfolded the device will offer the functionality of a tablet complete with multi-tasking and a big screen, but can then be folded into a smartphone. ”When we deliver a foldable phone, it has to be really meaningful to our customer,” Koh told CNET yesterday. “If the user experience is not up to my standard, I don’t want to deliver that kind of products.” Although he expected the hybrid device to initially find a niche market, he said that he believed it would expand, and that “we do need a foldable phone.” In February this year,  it was revealed that Samsung is working on a phone with a foldable screen, which is rumoured to be called the Galaxy X and is set to launch this year. The Galaxy X was reportedly shown to insiders at January's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) this year and has recently passed certification and is view-able on Samsung's support site.
