Soweto - Two decomposed bodies of the unidentified boy and girl whose ages are estimated around 11 and 10 respectively, were found buried in a single shallow grave, with their hands tied and blindfolded in Dobsonville, Soweto West. Police in the area have opened two cases of murder following the discovery of the decomposed bodies at a veld behind Slovoville cemetery. The bodies were allegedly found by a passer-by on Monday. “At this stage, no cases of missing children were reported at any of the police stations within the Soweto West Cluster. Therefore, the possibility that the children could have been reported missing outside of the Cluster, cannot be ruled out. "Police are thus appealing for information from members of the public, especially where people know of two children, a boy and a girl who went missing. This will assist with the identification of the victims and ultimately, the apprehension of the suspects,” police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said. Makhubele also noted that the SAPS have been instructed to prioritise cases against women and children and will leave no stone unturned to ensure that the perpetrators of theses heinous crimes against the children are found to face the full might of the law.  siphumelele.khumalo@inl.co.za  * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
