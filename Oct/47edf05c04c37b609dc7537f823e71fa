CAPE TOWN – When Destiny 2 launched, it had some neat changes to the gameplay mechanics that it’s predecessor had accomplished. However, it removed a lot of the grind that Destiny players had come to know and love. After many updates and two expansions, we saw some great changes put in place that improved the game and restored some of the glory that hardcore players remember from the first game. Forsaken, the most recent expansion to grace Destiny 2, promises to fix a lot of the gripes within the community in the same way that The Taken King expansion did for Destiny 1. The game’s narrative sees your guardian hunting down the Awoken Prince, Uldren Sov, and the Scorn for murdering Cayde-6, the lovable rogue and Hunter Vanguard. The quest sees us tracking down his murderers across the solar system to the Tangled Shore and the Dreaming City. Both locations, while vastly different, have a strong sense of corruption to them. The game also features a new PvE and PvP hybrid mode called Gambit. In fireteams of four, players will need to rack up motes of light to summon a Primeval. Defeating the Primeval nets you a win, but banking certain amounts of motes sends enemies over to the opposing team to hinder their progress. It’s a fantastic mode and the solid amount of cooperation needed to pick up a win is great. Forsaken fixes a lot of what was missing from the Destiny 2 grind and developers Bungie should be commended on their efforts with this expansion. WATCH:   Buy Destiny 2: Forsaken at www.loot.co.za
