The city councilâ€™s internal legal adviser tried to assist to correct these defects, to no avail. Approval has subsequently been granted to file a notice of opposition to this application. The city council understands that in the context of the national election due to take place in 2019, many political agendas and narratives will be propagated and emotive statements, that are not based on fact will become increasingly characteristic during this time. However, the city council will continue to ensure that it argues the facts and sticks to policy, by-laws and legislation. Regarding the continued misleading tariff statements, the city council has stated that the tariff relief that it has decided to give our residents is an interim arrangement. The city council made the decision to reduce the tariff after a meeting with the Department of Water and Sanitation, the agricultural sector and other municipalities. The city council awaited formal feedback from the national government but this was not forthcoming. The city council then decided to lower the restrictions and the associated tariff as an interim measure as: * The dam recovery has been greater and faster than expected. * Good conservation efforts by Capetonians has helped to avoid a disaster scenario. * There is no further need to remain on the extreme water restrictions and tariffs, which were in place to mitigate an extreme water shortage situation. * Further delays in decision-making would lead to residents paying the highest, most extreme tariff for many more months. * Councillor Raelene Arendse, Mayco member for Corporate Services. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
