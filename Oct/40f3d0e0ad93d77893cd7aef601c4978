Berlin - A woman who has accused football star Cristiano Ronaldo of raping her gained courage from the #MeToo movement to file a complaint, her lawyer has said. The Juventus and Portugal forward has denied any wrongdoing after being accused by Kathryn Mayorga of raping her in Las Vegas in 2009. At a press conference in Las Vegas Wednesday, lawyer Leslie Stovall said: "The #MeToo movement and the women who have stood up and disclosed sexual assaults publicly have given Ms Mayorga a lot of courage and has enabled her to come forward to file her civil complaint and to police." Mayorga, who was not at the press conference, has left Las Vegas to escape the attention surrounding the case, Stovall said. Ronaldo had said on Twitter Wednesday he awaited the result of a reopened police inquiry "with tranquillity." "I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in," he wrote. "Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense." * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. dpa
