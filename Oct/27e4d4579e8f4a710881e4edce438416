CAPE TOWN – Google announced that it will be adding new features to help users organise their travel plans better across several areas of the company’s services.  Google announced in a blog post that it will be adding relevant trip-related suggestions directly in Google search. Features such as a Your Trips feature will allow users to track flights and hotels they have booked as well as organise trips that are still in the planning progress on one platform. To see Your Trips, search for “my trips” on Google, or tap on the Your Trips tab from Google Flights or Hotels on your phone. Additionally, Google is adding a new hotel location score, which ranks the neighbourhood of a hotel is based on factors such as proximity to bars, landmarks or public transportation. Google is also adding details on getting to and from the nearest airport. "When you look for top travel destinations worldwide—even if you haven’t booked anything yet—we’ll help jump-start your trip planning with relevant suggestions right in Google Search. We’ll show you things to do, day plans or travel articles. As you start booking and receive your flight or hotel email confirmations in Gmail, these travel recommendations will be further customized in organic search results on Google," said Berna Erol, Product Manager of Travel in a statement. "For example, if you’re searching “Austin” and already booked your hotel, you’ll see things like flight prices, weather and events for your dates of travel, and even restaurants near where you're staying."   – BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
