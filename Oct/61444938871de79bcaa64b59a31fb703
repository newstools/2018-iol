CAPE TOWN – Instagram has announced a new feature that will allow users to follow people they’ve met in real life a lot easier. The company is calling the feature Nametag and it works by showing your username on your phone in a format that allows it to be scanned by your soon-to-be follower. According to Instagram, This tag can also be customised with additional designs, colours and stickers. How it works: 1. Go to your profile, hit the menu button on the top right, 2. Select “Nametag” to display your own code. 3. When you want to scan someone else’s code, you can do so by swiping right into the camera and scanning the tag. Nametag will be launching globally starting today and it’s available on both iOS and Android. This feature is similar to QR code scanning found on other social networks.  Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat users can generate QR codes for others to scan and quickly find accounts. Music app, Spotify has the same function when trying to find music tracks.  (Image by Instagram) BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
