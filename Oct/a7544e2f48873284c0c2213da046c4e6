CAPE TOWN – Liquid Telecom SA is set to undergo retrenchments amid taking on a new digitally-enhanced operating model – which includes the automation of jobs. The company announced the news in a statement on Monday according to a report by Business Tech. Liquid Telecom SA has over 1 100 employees and the retrenchments will only affect the South African operations. “Our adoption of technologies has resulted in the company contemplating structural changes that supports a digitally enhanced operating model,” it said. “The change may result in a reduction of the company’s full-time staff complement. “We have already informed all staff members of the decision and our main priority will be to support our people over the forthcoming weeks as we go through the consultation process. “Through this transition period, Liquid Telecom remains committed to building Africa’s digital future and collaborating with our customers to connect, innovate and grow throughout their entire digitization journey,” it said. In other news, Liquid Telecom has succeeded in Africa where the infamous Cecil John Rhodes did not, in connecting the Cape to Cairo. At the end of the 19th century, Rhodes had a dream to build a Cape-to-Cairo railway route and conquer “Darkest Africa”, but he only got as far as what today is called Zimbabwe in his lifetime. It took Liquid Telecom 10 years to realise its Cape-to-Cairo network of 10 000km in its “One Africa” broadband vision, encompassing a 60 000km network. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
