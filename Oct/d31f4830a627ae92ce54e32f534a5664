CAPE TOWN - The DA on Tuesday confirmed that it has laid criminal charges against outgoing Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille and mayoral committee member Brett Herron. This in line with the recommendations of the Bowmans report. City of Cape Town Speaker Dirk Smit brought the charges against De Lille in terms of the Municipal Systems Act for allegedly shielding officials involved in tender fraud and irregular payments, the deputy chairwoman of the DA's federal council, Natasha Mazzone, said. Herron was charged in terms of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act. Mazzone said the party was surprised that De Lille had signaled she would not step down on Wednesday, as she had made an agreement with party leader Mmusi Maimane to do so. "Based on her comments, our lawyers have written to De Lille’s lawyers to state that we expect her to vacate the mayoral office tomorrow as per the agreement." De Lille is preparing a legal challenge to the 2 000-page Bowmans report. She said on Monday that she wished to clear her name before vacating her position. Mazzone accused her of "never-ending delaying tactics". African News Agency (ANA)
