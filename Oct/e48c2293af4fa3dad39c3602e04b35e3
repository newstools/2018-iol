Kimberley - A Kimberley mother accused of attempting to murder her two sons by setting a car alight while the two boys were inside, has requested that her bail conditions be relaxed. The 35-year-old woman, a former police official, appeared in the Kimberley Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday on two charges of attempted murder and two charges of child abuse/deliberate neglect of a child following an incident on March 10 2018, when she allegedly set a vehicle alight while her two sons, aged six and 10 years, were inside. She was arrested on May 29 2018 and subsequently released on R2 000 bail. The woman was on Tuesday wearing a bright red, layered chiffon dress with sparkly gold embellishments and was supported by two female family members also dressed in red and gold regalia. While waiting for the accused to be called, the three women stood in the court corridors and proclaimed to passers-by who commented on their red outfits that they were “covered in the blood of Jesus”, while also singing church hymns referring to “the blood of Jesus”. The accused, who is also facing a charge of theft stemming from a separate incident, appeared agitated while appearing before Magistrate Cordelia Kgopa and could be seen nervously tapping on the accused’s dock. Kgopa postponed the matter to next month for a senior prosecution decision after the woman’s lawyer, Mario Williams, requested a postponement for discussions about the possible relaxation of his client’s bail conditions. The State prosecutor, Victor Thetele, added that the postponement would also serve as time to ascertain who will prosecute the matter. Diamond Fields Advertiser
