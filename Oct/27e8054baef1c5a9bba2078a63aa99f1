JOHANNESBURG - Merchandise transport, warehousing, distribution and logistics solutions company Value Group said on Friday it had benefitted from increased volumes from certain existing and new customers in the six months to August 31. It said headline earnings per share for the interim period was expected to rang between 31.3 cents and 32.4 cents compared with 5.4 cents over the same period last year. The associated increased revenue and restructured overhead costs from its higher volumes from existing and new customers had resulted in earnings growth, the company said in a trading update. "In addition, the once-off BEE (black economic empowerment) equity transaction costs, which were incurred in the company’s previous interim reporting period ended 31 August 2017, had a negative effect on the prior period’s earnings," it said. Value group is due to publish its interim results on October 24. - African News Agency (ANA)
