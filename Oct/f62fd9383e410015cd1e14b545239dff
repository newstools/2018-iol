DURBAN - Paul Harris, rain's Chairman, announced at the South Africa Investment Conference that rain will be launching a new 5G wireless network. Spectrum is a key driver of 5G and the effective use of these scarce resources is of extreme importance. Rain will use their current allocated spectrum and leverage its existing LTE network to set up the 5G network using 3.6GHz spectrum. This approach of sharing facilities and leveraging existing infrastructure will allow rain to roll out the 5G network in a fast and cost-effective manner. The first application of rain's 5G network will be to provide ultra-broadband services to homes and SME’s. The network will provide fibre-like speeds without the installation complexities, time delays and cost of laying fibre in under-serviced areas. The technology has the potential to effectively cut down the cost of ultra-broadband internet access for a broad section of South Africans. The company's G network will in time cover a wide range of new applications like IoT, smart cities and self-driving vehicles. Early access to 5G networks will give the existing technology industry in South Africa and new start-ups a head start to become leaders in applications that can be used domestically and exported internationally.  5G networks have the potential to be game changing for education in South Africa. rain is determined to be at the forefront of the evolution of 5G networks globally.  It will be demonstrating its 5G network running live in Cape Town from 12 November 2018. It will cover areas such as virtual and augmented reality, impact of 5G on education, the social and economic implications of 5G for South Africa and the engineering behind 5G. AfricaCom, Africa's largest telecommunications conference, will be held in the Cape Town during the same week. Follow the Business Report on Instagram here BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
