Dortmund - The circumstances around the death of a 5-month-old baby girl who fell to her death from the window of a refugee hostel in Germany at the weekend remained unclear on Monday. "We are talking about an accident so far. At this present time there are no indications of a crime," a spokesman for the police in the western German city of Bochum said on Monday. An autopsy has been ordered after the incident at refugee accommodation in the city of Herne next to Bochum. The girl fell from the window on the second floor late on Friday evening and tumbled 8 metres to the ground. The baby was apparently lying on a table near the window before the accident happened, a spokesman said. There were two other siblings in the room at the time who have yet to be questioned. The baby girl was initially revived by an emergency doctor and was taken with her mother, who comes from Eritrea, to a hospital in the nearby city of Gelsenkirchen, where she later succumbed to her injuries on Saturday morning. The mother is suffering from shock. dpa
