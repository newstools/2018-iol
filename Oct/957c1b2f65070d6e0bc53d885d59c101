Cape Town - Former MEC for Economic Development and Tourism, Mxolisi Dukwana has indicated that he is prepared to testify against Ace Magashule before the Zondo Commission into State Capture. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on Magashule to answer questions regarding allegations of state capture and corruption during his term of office in the Free State. "The Free State government has been a conduit through which the resources were distributed to the Gupta family and other companies in the province. This includes the Vrede Dairy Farm, the landing of the Guptas in the Waterkloof Air Force Base with Magashule’s assistance and the exorbitant amounts paid by the Province towards the New Age Breakfast," said DA MP Patricia Kopane. The next witnesses are expected to be former minister Barbara Hogan and Pravin Gordhan. Hogan's testimony will be heard on November 12 and Gordhan will appear before the commission on November 15. * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535. IOL
