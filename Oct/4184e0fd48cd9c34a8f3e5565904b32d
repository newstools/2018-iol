Mexico City - Hurricane Willa has uprooted trees, caused power cuts and forced schools to suspend classes in Mexico, but appears to have claimed no lives, officials said on Wednesday. The Category 3 storm made landfall on Tuesday evening after hurtling towards the country's western coastline at up to 195 kilometres per hour. It then weakened to a tropical storm. "Fortunately we did not have to mourn the loss of human lives," Sinaloa state governor Quirino Ordaz Coppel told the media company Televisa. However, the storm damaged a hospital in the city of Escuinapa and cut electricity and drinking water supplies in some areas, the governor added. Falling trees and utility poles blocked roads, leaving some places isolated, Ordaz said. About 4,250 people were evacuated in the states of Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco, Radio Formula reported, citing civil protection coordinator Luis Felipe Puente. School classes were suspended in seven municipalities in Sinaloa, as well as in some cities in Nayarit, Durango and Jalisco. Material damage caused by the storm was still to be evaluated. The storm caused waves up to six metres high on the coast. The authorities remained on alert for possible heavy rains and flooding. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. dpa
