CAPE TOWN – Google is making it a lot easier to delete this history within search itself today. Google announced that users will now be allowed to review and delete recent search history within Google search itself. Since the company stores a record of everything you search for on Google.com, it wants these new changes to make Google users a little more aware of the control they have over their account. Google will be creating quicker access to controls like disabling ad personalization or even preventing Google sites from saving activity. The tech giant is making these changes in search on desktop and mobile web then iOS and Android updates will come soon. It is also planning to expand these same changes to services like Maps next year, in an effort to overhaul the company’s privacy controls. This comes after a recent Google+ privacy flaw that leaked private profile data of at least 500 000 users may have been exposed to hundreds of external developers. WATCH:   BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
