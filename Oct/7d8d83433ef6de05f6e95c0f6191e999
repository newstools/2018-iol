Sathu said that as many people were likely to change jobs during their working life, they must consider the financial implications that come with this, especially long-term plans such as retirement planning. “People change jobs for a number of reasons and in most cases, when the move takes place, it has some implications on their finances. Some of the common reasons for changing jobs are career development, growth, better salary and benefits or relocation. Changing jobs is more likely to have a direct impact on the individual’s finances as they may be getting a better salary compared to the previous job, spending more or less on transport, for example,” he said. Sathu has unpacked three scenarios that people may be faced with when changing jobs:   Meanwhile, Jaco Pretorius, chief executive of Ensimini Financial Services, said amendments to the Pensions Fund Act, announced earlier this year, were a step in the right direction. “While it has been easy for the retirement savings industry to blame consumer apathy for poor consumer decisions, it is often more likely the result of a lack of access to relevant and unbiased information,” said Pretorius. The amendments stipulated that funds are required to ensure that members have access to retirement benefits counselling before they make any decisions and no money can be transferred or withdrawn unless this has been done. “Far too many members of retirement funds do not fully understand the long-term implications of the options available to them. Statistics reflect that a staggering 97percent of members that withdraw prior to retirement elect to take their accumulated benefit as a lump sum without fully appreciating the long-term impact on their retirement,” said Pretorius. He added that in many instances this behaviour is a function of the individual’s economic circumstances, but is often a result of a lack of access to appropriate counselling. PERSONAL FINANCE
