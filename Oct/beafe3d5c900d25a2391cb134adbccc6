Kampala - At least 17 people were killed when torrential rains caused a landslide in Uganda, police and rescue officials said on Thursday. Heavy downpours caused massive boulders and mud to slide down the slopes of the Elgon mountain range in eastern Uganda, burying numerous homes in the parish of Bukalasi in Bududa district. "We confirm that 17 people have so far died, but the number could rise," police spokesman Patrick Onyango told dpa by telephone. "The situation is tense as community members are scared and fleeing their homes for safety," said Uganda Red Cross spokeswoman Irene Nakasiita. Rescue efforts were hampered by the ongoing rain, which was blocking roads and making the area inaccessible, Nakasiita said. Landslides are a common occurrence in the mountainous district, where torrential rains killed more than 100 people in 2010. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. dpa dpa
