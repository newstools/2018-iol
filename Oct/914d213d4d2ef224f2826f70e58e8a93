CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Monday announced that it would charge outgoing Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille under section 119 of the Municipal Systems Act. The party said it was likely that the city’s suspended transport commissioner Melissa Whitehead and the mayoral council member for transport Brett Herron would also be criminally charged. The deputy chairwoman of the DA’s federal council, Natasha Mazzone, said the criminal acts happened in relation to the rigging of the city’s BYD tender and the irregular payment of R50 million in the procurement of Volvo chassis. A 2,000 page report by law firm Bowmans, tabled in the council last week, called for action against De Lille, Herron and Whitehead. The party’s announcement follows a defiant appearance by De Lille at the Cape Town Press Club on Monday. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
