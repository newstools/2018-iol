JOHANNESBURG - Mining group Anglo American Platinum said on Wednesday it had recently brought two Kom-Vision-equipped earthmoving vehicles into production at its Mogalakwena complex in a significant step towards improving safety at the mine. The technology gives the truck operator a 360-degree bird’s eye view and significantly reduces the risks associated with a man-machine interface. “This technology sets a new benchmark. It improves our ability to integrate into future collision avoidance systems," Mogalakwena mine general manager Richard Cox said. "In line with our strategy of FutureSmart MiningTM, it will generate close-to-real-time health and performance data that will support us in optimising our operations." Anglo American Platinum CEO Chris Griffith said investing in the equipment was a major step in increasing safety levels at the company's mines. "We remain committed to our objective of eliminating fatalities with a zero-harm mindset," he said. "And we recognise that although we have made significant progress in improving safety over the years, there is still much to do. This technology will eliminate a number of risks and we look forward to benefitting from the improved safety and operational features of these trucks.” - African News Agency (ANA)
