INTERNATIONAL – Volkswagen on Thursday said it will offer trade-in incentives and a bonus for scrapping older diesel vehicles in Germany, in a move to stave off driving bans in polluted cities. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her coalition partners agreed earlier this month on plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes. In other news,  Volkwagen has continued with its expansion into sub-Saharan Africa and signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Ghanaian government to establish a vehicle assembly facility in the country and assess the feasibility of introducing a modern mobility concept. Thomas Schäfer, chairperson and managing director of Volkswagen Group South Africa, which is responsible for the sub-Saharan Africa region, said the first locally assembled vehicles were planned to be on the streets in Accra, the capital of Ghana, early next year. Schäfer and Ghanaian Minister of Trade and Industry Alan Kyerematen signed the MoU last week in the presence of German chancellor Angela Merkel and Ghanaian vice-president Mahamudu Bawumia. Reuters
