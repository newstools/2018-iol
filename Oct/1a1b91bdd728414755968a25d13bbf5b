Kinshasa - At least 50 people were killed on Saturday when a tanker lorry crashed into another lorry in the town of Mbuba, in the western Democratic Republic of Congo. Another 100 people were seriously injured in the accident, said the governor of the Kongo Central province, Atou Matubwana. The tanker was on its way from the eastern city of Matadi to the national capital Kinshasa, said Matubwana. It was initially unclear exactly why or how it collided with the truck. The tanker exploded, causing a fire in Mbuba, according to local residents. Fatal road accidents occur frequently in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in several other African countries, in large part due to poor infrastructure and defective vehicles. dpa
