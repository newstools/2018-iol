JOHANNESBURG – South Africa’s state-owned power utility Eskom warned of the risk of load-shedding on Monday following power constraints due to maintenance and unplanned outages at several of its electricity-generating units. The power system was “severely constrained”, said Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the nation’s power. “It’s mainly due to some units being offline, some for maintenance purposes and others because of unplanned outages,” said Eskom’s spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe. Meanwhile the power utility's group executive for generation, Thava Govender, on Monday tendered his resignation after assuming the position only in March this year, said Phasiwe. Govender, who was also acting group executive of risk and sustainability, has worked for Eskom for 27 years. During that time, Govender served in various capacities including as group executive of transmission and customer services and as the divisional executive of generation division. Phasiwe said that Eskom chief executive, Phakamani Hadebe, has wished Govender well in his new endeavours. Additional reporting by African News Agency. Reuters
