Polowane - The driver of a bus which overturned, killing nine people on the N1 in Limpopo province on September 21, is expected to appear in Polokwane Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. George Temba, 41, a Zimbabwean national, was arrested a few days later after trying to flee. Police found him hiding in a trailer transporting goods and headed to Zimbabwe. Temba faces nine charges of culpable homicide and a charge of reckless driving. He appeared in court last week where his application for bail was denied. The case was postponed to Tuesday for further investigation. All nine victims of the crash are from Zimbabwe. * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535.
