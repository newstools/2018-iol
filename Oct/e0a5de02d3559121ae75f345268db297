Johannesburg - As residents of Ennerdale, Eldorado Park, Lenasia and other predominantly coloured areas in Gauteng are protesting over “marginalisation and neglect” by provincial government, many social media users questioned if their sense marginalisation is genuine. The protest in Ennerdale took a violent turn when police fired rubber bullets to disperse a small crowd of protestors. It is believed they were pelting stones at passing cars and officers who were deployed to the area. This protest on Friday comes just days after residents of Westbury protested against shootings and other crimes blamed on drug dealers in the area. They had also accused officers from the Sophiatown Police Station of being in cahoots with criminals in Westbury. The protesters told members of the media that under the apartheid regime they were "not white enough", and post-1994 they felt that they are "not black enough" for their concerns to be heard by local and national government. Many outraged South Africans responded by hitting back on social media.             Meanwhile, Johannesburg Water said the reservoir is running "critically low" due to "high demand in the area". They also said they are unable to attend to service calls as we are unable to access the area due to the protest. IOL
