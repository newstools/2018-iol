JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Friday said journalist and the owner of the Joburg Inner Gazette, Moses Moyo, told stories of people who were often forgotten, and he did so with humility and passion. Moyo passed away at his home in Johannesburg on Thursday night, following a short illness. DA spokesperson John Moodey said Moyo had a passion for writing about low-cost housing for residents in the city, inner city dwellers and hijacked buildings and their living conditions. The media fraternity is poorer without the dedicated media professional. “We wish to express our deepest condolences to his family, the media fraternity and those he worked with at the Joburg Inner Gazette," Moodey said. Adding to this was the South African Jewish community, which said it was shocked and grieved by Moyo's passing. "A social and political activist, Moyo was a devoted, courageous friend of the Jewish community and a staunch, principled defender of Israel. "Side by side with the Jewish leadership, he campaigned tirelessly against attempts to defame and delegitimize the Jewish State and calls for South Africa to break off ties with it." National director of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD) Wendy Kahn meanwhile, described Moyo as a great friend of SA Jewry someone "whose  unrelenting energy, political acumen and strategic vision had brought a whole new dimension to the ongoing battle against anti-Israel prejudice and disinformation in SA society".         “Moses selfless, passionate about assisting us and those around him” she said. The Jewish community sent its condolences to Moyo's family and said that the SA Zionist Federation (SAZF), SAJBD, SA Friends of Israel (SAFI) and other organisations that had worked with him would set up an educational trust fund for his young children. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
