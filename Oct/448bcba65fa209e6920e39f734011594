Singapore - A British national was charged on Friday for falsely claiming 13 years ago that a terrorist attack would take place during Singapore's National Day celebrations. Khor Chye Siew, 42, was charged with providing false information with intent to cause a public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person, according to local newspaper The Straits Times. Khor had allegedly sent an email to an official at the Ministry of Communications, Information and the Arts at 10 am on July 24, 2005, informing her that a terrorist attack would take place during the country's 40th National Day Parade. In the email, he said the country's intelligence service had failed to detect all terrorist activities here, and that they had to take his tip-off seriously or something horrible would happen. "There is gonna (sic) be three suicide bombings during your country's 40th National Day Parade, I know who & where these crooks are," he wrote. He sent the email "to cause unnecessary alarm, so that resources would be deployed to look into the information," according to a statement by police authorities on Thursday. Khor was only arrested in May this year at Changi Airport while attempting to enter Singapore after flying in from London. If found guilty of the hoax, he could be imprisoned for up to one year and fined up to 5 000 Singapore dollars (3 620 US dollars), or both. dpa
