CAPE TOWN – HMD Global chief product officer Juho Sarvikas made the announcement that Nokia has chosen its 7 Plus to get the Android Pie Operating System (OS) update. The device will be joining a small lineup of non-Google phones to get an update. Other devices include Essential Phones, eight Motorola phones, and the OnePlus 6, which runs a modified version of Android 9 Pie, as well as Google’s Pixel phones. Android 9 Pie brings a range of useful new features, like the adaptive battery, tweaked navigation, and improved notifications that cut out the unnecessary app usage. Android 9 or Android Pie uses artificial intelligence to allow users' smartphones to learn more about what they like. The OS learns and adapts to usage patterns and comes with features like Adaptive Battery, which learns the apps you use most and prioritises battery for them. The Nokia 7 Plus will be the first non-Pixel phone to get the Digital Wellbeing features, which shows a dashboard of your phone habits and tracks app time usage. The Nokia 7 Plus is a budget $400 (R 5 643) Android phone that’s not officially available in the US but mainly targeted toward Asia and India.        BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
