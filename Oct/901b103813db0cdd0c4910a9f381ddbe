Bangkok - A 4-metre-long python was found asleep in front of a beer cooler in a convenience store in eastern Thailand. Staff members of a 7-Eleven outlet in Chonburi province, 120 kilometres south-east of Bangkok, spotted the snake on Sunday, before calling rescue volunteers to capture it, reported news website Coconuts Bangkok. Nobody saw the python coming in but the staff believed it entered through the front door to evade the flood outside as Thailand is currently in the rainy season, according to the website. The sleeping python was captured in merely five minutes before being released into the wild. Snakes are known to lurk in many places in the South-East Asian country - from car trunks to toilets and laundry baskets. In Bangkok alone, more than 35,000 snakes were reported and captured last year. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. dpa
