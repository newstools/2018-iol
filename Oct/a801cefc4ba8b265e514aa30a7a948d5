CAPE TOWN – At an event in New York City, Apple announced a new iPad Pro. The company has taken the device and redesigned it by removing the home button from the front to allow for more screen space. Apple’s new iPad Pro has FaceID, which Apple said is the most secure facial recognition that can be used on any tablet or computer. The iPad Pro will be available in two variants,  the smaller iPad Pro features an 11-inch display and a 12.9-inch tablet. Internally, the devices will be powered with Apple’s A12X Bionic processor, a seven-core GPU and octa-core processor. Compared to the previous generation of iPad Pros, this allows it to provide 35 percent faster single-core performance and 90 percent faster multi-core processing. According to Apple, the GPU on its new A12X Bionic chipset delivers Xbox One S-class graphics. The device has a 12MP camera that can record video at 4K resolution with a frame rate of 60fps. The company also said that its new iPad Pros are faster than 92 percent of all portable PCs sold in the past 12 months. The devices have a 1TB storage capacity and now include a USB Type-C connector. Apple also launched its new Pencil alongside the iPad Pros, which attaches to the side of the iPad Pro magnetically and pairs with the device and can charge wirelessly. The company added that users will be able to get a full desktop Photoshop experience when using the iPad Pro. Pricing The new iPad Pro 11-inch will be available from $799 (R12 000). The new iPad Pro 12.9-inch will be priced from $999. Both iPad Pro models will be available in Wi-Fi-only and Wi-Fi+LTE models.
