CAPE TOWN – Telecommunications company Qualcomm unveiled new 60GHz Wi-Fi chipsets that are capable of delivering more than 10Gbps network speeds. According to the company, it will be the first in the market with optimizations based on the 802.11ay specification, which will allow for high speeds and wide coverage. Rahul Patel, senior vice president and general manager of connectivity and networking at Qualcomm said in a statement: "Our 11ay solution provides the industry with the critical building blocks needed to take connectivity performance to the next level.” The QCA64x8 chipsets will be used for infrastructure and fixed wireless access, and the QCA64x1 chipsets are designed for mobile applications. "The mmWave-based 60GHz Wi-Fi is distinct from the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands in that it is a low-interference, bandwidth-rich spectrum that delivers increased wireless capacity, multi-gigabit speeds, and ultra-low latency”. According to Patel, the chips are empowered by double-digit gigabit-per-second speeds and provides wire-equivalent latencies enabling new and exciting gaming and entertainment experiences such as 4K streaming, virtually lag-free mobile screen casting to an entertainment system. It will also allow for better wireless virtual and augmented reality experiences, all while providing high power efficiency to significantly extend battery life. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
