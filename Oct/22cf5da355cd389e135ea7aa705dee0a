Wellington - Pristine beaches, kiwis, women's suffrage, and gumboot throwing are some of the highlights on the itinerary for Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan when they visit New Zealand later this month. "The duke and duchess have a particular interest in youth, mental health and conservation, and they will have the opportunity to meet many New Zealanders working in those important areas, while also getting to enjoy some of our unique environment," Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement on Friday. Harry and Meghan, officially known as the duke and duchess of Sussex, married in May in a star-studded ceremony watched the world over. They will come to New ZealandÂ after attending the Invictus Games in Sydney and following visits to Fiji and Tonga. The young royals will arrive in New Zealand's capital Wellington on October 28 and are scheduled to attend a reception celebrating the 125th anniversary of women's suffrage in New Zealand. The following day they will travel to tourist magnet Abel Tasman National Park, where they will be welcomed by local Maori tribes. In Auckland, the couple will visit Pillars, a charity supporting children who have a parent in prison. As a wedding present to the couple, New Zealand's government donated 5 000 New Zealand dollars (3,200 US dollars) to the charity. They will also join children in a gumboot throwing contest. Before leaving the country they will head to Rotorua for a traditional Maori welcome and a chance to meet New Zealand's iconic kiwi birds at a nature park. dpa
