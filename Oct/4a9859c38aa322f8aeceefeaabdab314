Johannesburg - Westbury in Johannesburg is in turmoil as protesters take their anger over what they say is poor policing, crime and gangsterism to the streets. One Rea Vaya station was torched overnight and roads were blockaded, wreaking havoc with traffic in and around the suburb. The latest protest comes after a woman was killed by a stray bullet on Thursday, that is believed to be from an exchange of gunfire in a violent gang turf war in the area. Her 10-year-old daughter was also wounded in the shooting.   On Monday, the community of Westbury in Johannesburg called on the provincial government to investigate the alleged complicity of police with those responsible for the ongoing violence in the area. DA Gauteng Premier candidate Solly Msimanga also slammed police. "It is clear that SAPS is not doing enough to curb crime in the area and that the residents of Westbury have lost faith in the police as the ANC is failing in its mandate to keep residents safe," Msimanga said. Police Minister Bheki Cele expected to address the community on Tuesday. * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535. IOL
