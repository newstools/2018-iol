JOHANNESBURG – Family-owned construction firm Giuricich Bros said on Thursday JSE-listed retail real estate investment trust Vukile Property Fund had acquired a substantial section of its new premium-grade offices in Rosebank. Giuricich began work on the 6400m² office block development in September 2017 and it is set for completion by year end. Vukile has invested in 1,500 sqm of sectional title offices and will begin working from the new address from early 2019. "As a leading listed property company with international assets, Vukile knows exactly what makes an excellent head office location and offers great value," Giuricich's Adrian Faccio said. "We are thrilled that they chose our 104 Oxford Road development for their new headquarters.” The office block is located in the rapidly developing financial district of Rosebank and offers easy access to the Gautrain station, providing a quick link to Johannesburg, Sandton, Pretoria and OR Tambo International Airport.
