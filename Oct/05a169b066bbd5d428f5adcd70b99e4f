The trial of Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso continues in the Port Elizabeth High Court when the second State witness takes the stand. Last week, Cheryl Zondi, the first state witness, waived her right to be unnamed in the sex trial involving Omotoso and his two alleged henchwomen because she wanted the world to know what type of person he is. She was questioned extensively by defence attorney Peter Daubermann over the past two days. Zondi broke down several times but continued to answer the graphic questions put to her. The charismatic pastor faces 63 main charges and 34 alternative counts, including human trafficking, rape, sexual assault, racketeering, and conspiracy in aiding another person to commit sexual assault. His two alleged henchwomen, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, are accused of recruiting girls from all over the country for purposes of sexual exploitation. The 58-year-old televangelist allegedly trafficked more than 30 girls and women from various branches of his church to a house in Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal, where he allegedly sexually exploited them.
