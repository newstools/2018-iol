Port Elizabeth - Port Elizabeth police have arrested a 22-year-old man for the murder of his mother and father. Earlier this week police were alerted that neighbours had not seen the couple for more than a week. Police launched an extensive search for them and the father’s charred body was discovered on Wednesday morning. Described as a gruesome finding, the body of the suspect's 60-year-old father was discovered in an open field next to Mti Street, Govan Mbeki locality. His charred remains were found 70 metres from their home. Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said Kwadesi detectives arrested the man on Wednesday night after he made a confession and pointed out a grave where he had buried his mother. Beetge said the son’s arrest was made after community members in the area spotted him at a nearby street on Wednesday afternoon. “By 7pm last night the suspect confessed to the murders and led police to the grave where he buried the mother. Her body was not burnt like the father.” Beetge said initial reports by community members pointed towards the suspect being mentally challenged. However, Beetge said detectives observed him to be alert and responsive during questioning but suspected that he was a drug user. The suspect is expected to appear before the New Brighton Magistrate’s Court on Friday on two charges of murder. Beetge said the NPA would decide if further evaluation was required. Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie expressed appreciation towards the community for not taking the law into their own hands. "The alertness of the community led police to uncover this double murder. The suspect will be brought before court to face the consequences of his actions,” said Rabie. African News Agency/ANA
