Moscow - A second explosive device found among the personal possessions of the chief suspect in a deadly attack on a college in Crimea that left at least 17 dead on Wednesday has been disarmed, the RIA news agency cited officials as saying. Vladislav Roslyakov, 18, turned up at the college in the city of Kerch and went through the building shooting at fellow pupils before killing himself. Officials said earlier on Wednesday that an explosive device had gone off in the school's cafeteria during the attack. Russia's Investigative Committee said that the fatal attack was a case of mass murder not terrorism and named 18-year-old student Vladislav Roslyakov as its chief suspect in the rampage. Roslyakov had gone on a shooting spree in the college before committing suicide, the committee said, and could be seen beforehand on CCTV entering the school with a rifle. * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535.
