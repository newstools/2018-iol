CAPE TOWN – Oath, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications the company that owns Yahoo has created a new messaging app called Yahoo Together.  "Have you ever been in a group SMS thread with 10 people talking about 18 different things at once? It can make it hard to follow along, let alone plan a barbecue. We built Yahoo Together to fix that. It's group chat that makes life easier through organization and smart tools," said  Adam Mathes, Senior Director, Product Management at Oath. “Gather people into the groups you care most about (family, friends, book clubs, bowling leagues) and then split up your conversations with topics. So, instead of talking about 18 things at once, you can follow the topics you care about and mute the rest.” Yahoo Together allows photo and video sharing, and also lets you attach any file into a shared library for the group. A search function lets you find media in groups later down the line, rather than having to scroll through long chat histories. The app also offers shared calendars and the ability to set-up reminders and attach them to any message. This will notify the group at the scheduled time. Yahoo Together is available for iOS and Android. WATCH:   BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
