JOHANNESBURG, - More than 500 of Africa’s top future engineers, chemists, physicists, mathematicians and innovators are this week competiting at the country’s largest school-level science fair sponsored by state electricity company Eskom. The Eskom Expo for Young Scientists International Science Fair (ISF) brings together young scientists from South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Tanzania and Mexico who will showcase their innovative projects for a chance to win a scholarship to study in Germany, among other prizes. For the last 38 years, the expo has cultivated a passion for the sciences in young people, giving participants a way to explore science, technology, engineering, mathematics and innovation (STEMI). “The (expo) creates a platform for future scientists and engineers across South Africa, to establish a base for their future careers," its executive director Parthy Chetty said. "The competition is a great launch-pad for motivated youngsters keen to explore these fields and change not only their circumstances but their environments for the better." Engineering and digital technology giant Siemens is one of the major sponsors and has committed laptops and science kits as well as three full local bursaries in addition to an opportunity for one young scientist to go through a three and a half year mechatronics or electronics apprenticeship at the Siemens Technical Academy in Berlin. “Skills development and investing in our youth is imperative to grow innovation in Africa," Siemens CEO for Southern and Eastern Africa Sabine Dall’Omo said. Eskom group executive for transmission and acting group executive for sustainability and risk Thava Govender said the expo was a demonstration of the utility's "commitment to helping develop skilled science and engineering professionals, not only in South Africa but the rest of the continent". The expo is running from October 2-5 in Boksburg. - African News Agency (ANA)
