Johannesburg - The Gauteng EFF will on Wednesday open a case against former Hot 91.9FM DJ Sasha Martinengo following his comments on party leader Julius Malema. Martinengo was fired by the station on Tuesday for calling Malema a ''monkey" during his breakfast show. The station's managing director Lloyd Madurai said Martinengo commented on air: ''And people still listen to this monkey...'', referring to Malema. ''The values of this radio station include a full and unconditional commitment to the South African Bill of Rights and an all-encompassing respect for all our community, irrespective of their political point of view. The statement by the presenter violated the station’s code of conduct and its commitment to our national democratic values and furthermore is viewed in an extremely serious light,'' Madurai said in a statement posted on Facebook. Martinengo has since taken to Twitter to defend his remarks. The EFF Gauteng in a statement confirmed that its provincial chairperson and other officials of the Provincial Command Team (PCT), would open a case against Martinengo at the Douglasdale police station. "The EFF in Gauteng is deeply hurt by the racist insult brought onto the president of the EFF; the flagrant and repeated violation of his human rights is an unacceptable thing," the party said. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
