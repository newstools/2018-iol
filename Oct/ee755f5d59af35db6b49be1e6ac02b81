CAPE TOWN – Spotify is running a test feature called "What’s New" for some users that show new releases of artists. According to a report by The Verge, Spotify confirmed the test stating that they always testing new ways to create better-listening experiences for more users. Recently, the streaming service has added a new update for its Premium tier. The company redesigned its navigation and search on its mobile apps. It also added a new radio feature, which will give users a personalised station. The new design for the navigation and search pages put emphasis on introducing users to new music by placing recommended genres at the top of the page. The new artist radio feature uses the same algorithms for Discover Weekly and Spotify’s other personalised playlists and then creates it for any artist on songs that you choose. Spotify often runs a few of these tests publicly, so there’s no guarantee this feature will become official. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
