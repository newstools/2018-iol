PARLIAMENT - Parliament's multi-party women's caucus (MPWC) on Wednesday said while it was pleased with National Treasury's decision to make sanitary towels tax-exempt, it would continue advocating that sanitary products be provided free of charge. "We want to assure the women out there that we are continuing with our engagements on sanitary dignity, as we advocate for the provision of free sanitary products to indigent women and girls," MPWC chairperson Rosalia Morutoa said in a statement. Morutoa said while the committee had no oversight function over government it would continue pushing for "the emancipation of all women in South Africa" through social activism. "We appreciate the support and cooperation of various civil society and non-government organisations that collaborated with us on this journey," she said. On October 24, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni announced that it had accepted a recommendation that sanitary towels be sold free of value-added tax (VAT). The vat exemption comes into effect on April 1 next year. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. African News Agency (ANA)
