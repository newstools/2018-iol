 A true Cosmo should have a very pale blush pink – you just want the dryness of the cranberry balancing the drink out – but our 'Canon Cosmo' has a much richer hue. Using a homemade 'pink sour mix' we lend a complex tartness and sweetness that's leagues away from the pre-bought stuff. Using burnt orange and concord grape we nod to the classic, but add a richer complexity. For Cosmo lovers and loathers alike. 🦁🍇🍊🍸😻🌿 A post shared by  Dandelyan (@dandelyanbar) on Sep 20, 2018 at 12:51am PDT   When you have the world's best bar team together, the possibilities for cocktail magic are endless.
