JOHANNESBURG - The rand traded in a tight range against the US dollar during Friday’s European trading session. The South African currency started the day on the back foot due to somewhat disappointing Chinese data releases overnight. However, the rand later recovered some ground on the back of greenback softness as improved US equity prices reduced the safe-haven demand for US dollars. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.3 percent weaker at R14.40/$, after trading in the range of R14.32/$ - R14.46/$. The rand traded slightly stronger this morning. Expected range today R14.20/$ - R14.50/$. South African bourse The JSE All Share (-0.1 percent) ended weaker on Friday dragged by losses in large industrial (-1.1 percent) and technology (-0.9 percent) shares. In the overall emerging market sphere, the MSCI Emerging Market Index (+0.06 percent) traded marginally higher. In local news, Clover (+18.4 percent) shares rose to its highest in nearly two months after the dairy company said that it is in talks with an unnamed firm that intends to acquire all its shares. Brent crude oil The Brent oil price traded higher on Friday boosted by surging Chinese demand, after rising us crude inventories and trade war concerns caused the price to drop last week. At the close of local trade, the Brent oil price quoted 1.1 percent higher at $80.54/pb. Crude prices traded slightly weaker during Asian trade this morning.
