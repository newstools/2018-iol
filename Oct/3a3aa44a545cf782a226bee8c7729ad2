Tshwane - A raid on a house in Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni, on Wednesday led police to arrest two suspected drug dealers who were in possession of drugs, cash and South African Police Service paraphernalia. "Management of police in Gauteng have applauded the successful drug-bust and subsequent arrests following an intelligence-driven integrated operation, where members of the SAPS in Ekurhuleni West had teamed up with the Drug Enforcement Unit from Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department," said Gauteng police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini. "Police responded to a tip-off which led the integrated team to a house in Palm Ridge where police arrested two suspects aged 29 and 38 respectively, for dealing in and for possession of drugs after seizing an undisclosed amount of cash and drugs - CAT and crystal meth." Dlamini said on further investigation, police were led to a house in Katlehong where police seized more quantities of CAT. "Police also found at this house paraphernalia of the South African Police Service, whose ownership has since been confirmed. The drugs recovered are estimated R800 000," he said. The two suspects are expected to appear in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court on Thursday. "Police are urging members of the public to continue reporting crime by calling the Crime Stop number 08600 10111 or to report to the nearest police station," said Dlamini. African News Agency (ANA)
