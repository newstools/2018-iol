Rustenburg - New political party, African Transformation Movement (ATM), differ from other political parties because it is people driven, the party said on Saturday. "This is a party that is formed by the people. It is not formed by politicians who have broken away from other political parties. Therefore, the purpose is linked to its members. When checking existing political parties, there is a huge gap between the parties as well as the people they serve. This is the coming together of the people themselves," party president Vuyolwethu Zungula said at the North West provincial launch in Rustenburg. He said the party would not be entertaining offers from outside funding to maintain peace, explaining that the party members would contribute towards the party. "The funding is going to come from party members. We have noted in the country that political parties are not funded by its members, they are funded by the wealthy. That places the country in a difficult position because now these political parties are no longer advocating for the needs of the people rather be advocating for the needs of whoever is funding them," he said. The party said it was different from other religious political parties because they believed in a unitary government system instead of a federal system. It further aims to redefine politics from the negative ideas it currently holds such as bad behaviour and criminal activities. The next provincial launch will be held in the Eastern Cape next weekend, while the national launch will be held in Bloemfontein, Free State, from December 1. African News Agency/ANA
