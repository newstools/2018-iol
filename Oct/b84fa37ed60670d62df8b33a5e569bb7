The Cyril Ramaphosa administration came with the promise that it would be merciless on fraud, corruption and government wastage - but it has been short on delivery. We accept that justice requires time, but Ramaphosa is testing our patience to the limit. There appears to be a lack of vigour in pursuing even what appear to be the most obvious cases of malfeasance uncovered - and there are many. Some measure of satisfaction was received when the Constitutional Court last week found that former social development minister Bathabile Dlamini had misled the court in her handling of the social grants payment matter, and ordered her to personally pay 20% of the legal costs incurred by Black Sash and Freedom Under Law, which run into millions. Even given the divisions in the ANC, Ramaphosa can now demonstrate his resolve to us by firing Dlamini, who is now Minister for Women in the Presidency. We welcome the Treasuryâ€™s instruction to all government departments and state institutions to have officials responsible for incurring irregular expenditure pay back the money, be referred to the police or face disciplinary action. South Africans have been calling for such measures for years. It was too much to hope for in the Zuma years, but it also took the Ramaphosa administration too long to implement. Daily News
