INTERNATIONAL – As the political divide in the United States creeps into the dating scene, young singles are turning to those with similar political viewpoints to befriend. To meet this new demand, a social media company on Monday launched a new app that hopes to help young supporters of President Donald Trump look for romantic encounters, according to US media. The app, DonaldDaters, describes itself as an "American-based singles community connecting lovers, friends, and Trump supporters alike," and promises to "Make America date again." "For many young Trump supporters, liberal intolerance has made meeting and dating nearly impossible," Emily Moreno, CEO of DonaldDaters, said in a statement. "Support for the president has become a deal-breaker instead of an icebreaker. That's why we created a new platform for Trump supporters to meet people without being afraid of talking politics." On Apple's App Store, the subtitle for the free app tellingly reads "Meet the RIGHT partner". Since Trump's election fueled the expansion of political divide between conservatives and liberals, young conservatives are having an especially hard time finding dates in large metropolitan areas, which tends to lean liberal politically. Republicans have complained that they were ridiculed or insulted when their dates discover their political affiliations. Currently there is an opposite website - nevertrump.dating - which targets the anti-Trump crowd. The platform is "an all-inclusive, love-pairing dating site for those who oppose and resist President Donald Trump," according to the group that has initiated the website. Xinhua
