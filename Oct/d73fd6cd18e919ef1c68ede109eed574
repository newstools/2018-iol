CAPE TOWN – Evan Blass, a well-known tech reporter and known for his phone leaks from VentureBeat has struck again by putting Nokia under the spotlight. According to Blass, he revealed in a tweet that HMD Global is bringing back mid-range Nokia devices to the US through a partnership with Verizon. Blass added the tweet early this morning containing a leak of the new HMD-built device, calling it the Nokia 2.1V and it looks very similar to the Nokia 2.1. The only difference is that the alleged device will come with support from Verizon Wireless. IIf the image in the tweet is legit, the device will feature a  5.5-inch display, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 425 and an 8MP camera on the back. Keep in mind,  the leaked device doesn’t prove that Nokia phones will be headed back to the US. However, it does make it clear that Verizon might be testing out consumer interest in the phones.
