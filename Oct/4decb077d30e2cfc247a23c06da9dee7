CAPE TOWN - The Gauteng Department of Infrastructure Development (DID) says a pilot involving the use of drones is proving very successful in helping the department monitor its building projects. The drone programme was launched in Etwatwa, Benoni, in May this year and has changed the way the DID monitors and delivers its building projects such as new schools, clinics, libraries, community centres and hospitals. Department spokesperson Theo Nkonki said: "This has fundamentally changed the way DID monitors and delivers its social infrastructure projects. The precise on-the-ground monitoring will cut out wastage and corruption and ensure that public infrastructure is delivered within budget, set time frames and at the right quality." According to the department, since the launch, the programme has been "refined and enhanced" and has been strengthened with a range of technological advances through the work done by DID and IT specialists from the University of Johannesburg. "DID now employs five unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor its projects across Gauteng City Region’s five development corridors," Nkonki said. African News Agency (ANA)
