CAPE TOWN – PlayStation 4 owners are reporting that their consoles are being crashed by malicious messages. This is according to a report Engadget, the offending PSN message contains an unrecognised character which “effectively bricks their consoles”. After the console crashes, users then “have to either rebuild the database in Safe Mode or factory reset the system”. The report states that if users want to prevent the possibility of your console being affected, they can go the Settings menu in their PS4 and change their privacy settings so the option to receive messages is turned off. Sony did not provide comment to Engadget on the matter but the report continued to say that Sony could likely address the issue with a software update. Recently, the company announced that it will soon start testing the name change feature that will allow users to change their PlayStation Network Online ID on their PlayStation 4.
