Johannesburg - The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) has submitted documents to the state capture inquiry which it believes detail Eskom's corrupt deal with the Gupta family. The organisation says its documents show how Eskom helped the Gupta family obtain the Optimum coal mine deal. This deal subsequently led the power utility to pay millions of rand to Gupta owned companies that did it not have contracts with, Outa said. In another submission, the organisation details how it believes Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba bent over backwards to help the Gupta family gain work permits and visas. "While the Guptas entered the country long before Gigaba became Minister of Home Affairs. Emails from the Gupta leaks and testimonies during parliament’s inquiry into the department have revealed how Minister Gigaba expedited their applications and how public officials assisted the Gupta’s with visas and work permits," said the organisation. The commission of inquiry into state capture is investigating allegations of corruption largely centred around the infamous Gupta family and former president Jacob Zuma.     It has been alleged that the Gupta family used its relationship with Zuma to score business deals with state-owned enterprises. Billions of rand were allegedly paid out to the family in suspicious business deals involving government officials. The commission resumes on Wednesday, October 10, with the testimony of former minister of public enterprises Barbara Hogan.   IOL
