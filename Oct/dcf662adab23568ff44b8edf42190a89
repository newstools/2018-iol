CAPE TOWN – Spotify announced in a blog post that it will be releasing a new update for its Premium tier. The company redesigned its navigation and search on its mobile apps. It also added a new radio feature, which will give users a personalised station. The new design for the navigation and search pages put emphasis on introducing users to new music by placing recommended genres at the top of the page. The new artist radio feature uses the same algorithms for Discover Weekly and Spotify’s other personalised playlists and then creates it for any artist on songs that you choose. It acts as an endless playlist that’s tailored to you which can also be saved offline. The update also lowered Spotify’s total number of tabs from five to three. “Browse,” which mainly highlighted curated playlists and showed music by genre is now based on the search page. “Radio” is now an option you can play after searching for an artist. Additionally, Spotify’s song search has been changed. If users search for a song with a common name, Spotify will create a playlist based around the song instead of playing every version of the song. The update will be available globally to Premium subscribers on iOS and Android starting today. WATCH:   BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
