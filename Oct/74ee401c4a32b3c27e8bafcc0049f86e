JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s significant potential for New Zealand businesses is being explored by a New Zealand business delegation which has arrived in the country for a four-day visit. The delegation, which arrived on Tuesday and leaves on Saturday, is being led by New Zealand’s Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Fletcher Tabuteau. Representatives from Kiwi companies Enatel, Fonterra, Framecad, Gallagher, Jack Links NZ, Seequent and Zespri are accompanying Tabuteau, a statement reported. “The South African market presents significant potential for New Zealand businesses, and is our most diverse trading partner on the African continent with more than NZ$300 million in exports,” Tabuteau said. “Our Government supports New Zealand exporters to showcase their products and services to the world. Visits like this one are an important part of promoting the New Zealand brand and highlighting our values to a global audience of consumers.” In addition to the business talks the Kiwis will also discuss their wider relationship with Africa’s powerhouse. Tabautea said that his country's relationship with South Africa is the deepest and most diverse in Africa, highlighted by strong historical, political and sporting ties. “I am looking forward to meeting with my South African counterparts and leaders of businesses in South Africa to showcase our world leading trade and innovation credentials, and further strengthen the ties of trade and friendship between our two countries,” he added. - African News Agency (ANA)
