CAPE TOWN –  Facebook is adding a new feature to Groups that will allow users to have intergroup Messenger chats with the option to add up to 250 people. According to a report by Tech Crunch, The chats can also support audio or video calls with up to 50 people in them. The idea is that users in big groups will be able to have smaller conversations about things like local meetups that may not be relevant to the entire group. In-Group chats can be viewed by all members of the group, and anyone already in the group can join or be invited. The report also states that Facebook won’t spam you with notifications for each message in the thread until you accept the invitation to join. Users will be able to decide whether they want to get notifications when they’re directly @-mentioned. Group admins will also be able to end chats or only allow admins to start threads. Facebook will add the Messenger chat feature to groups and make it available on today. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
