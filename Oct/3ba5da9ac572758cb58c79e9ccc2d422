Pretoria - Several public order police unit members were stationed outside the Pretoria Magistrate's Court on Tuesday morning ahead of an appearance of a 20-year-old man accused of raping a six-year-old girl in the bathroom of the Dros restaurant in Silverton. Before 7 am, a police Nyala was also parked outside. Tshwane Metro Police officers have blocked off Francis Baard Street, adjacent to the court. Motorists were being instructed to continue straight on Sophie de Bruyn Street. The arrested suspect faces charges of rape, possession of drugs, assault with intent to do bodily harm and intimidation. It is alleged that on the day in question last month he followed the little girl from the play area to the toilets where he raped her. The girl's distraught mother caught the man in the act and raised the alarm. Some of the people who responded assaulted the suspect in the bathroom - others recorded videos with theirÂ cellphone. Members of several political parties and civil society organisations are expected to protest outside the court on Tuesday after a video of the bleeding naked man went viral. They are opposing bail. Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga is expected to also attend the court case. * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535. African News Agency (ANA)
