Copenhagen, Denmark - The man at the centre of a sex-abuse and financial crimes scandal that is tarnishing the academy that awards the Nobel Prize in Literature, has been found guilty and given a two-year jail sentence for a rape in 2011. Jean-Claude Arnault, a major cultural figure in Sweden, faced two counts of rape of a woman seven years ago. Stockholm District Court said Monday that the ruling was unanimous. Prosecutor Christina Voigt had demanded three years in prison for Arnault who is married to a Swedish Academy member. He had denied the charges, which have rocked the prestigious academy with seven members either being forced to leave or quitting in April. A total of 18 women have levelled sexual misconduct allegations against Arnault. In May, the academy announced that no prize would be awarded this year. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. AP
