Instructed by various liquidators, financial institutions and fleet managers, WH Auctioneers will hold a massive two-day auction of vehicles, construction equipment and a diversity of other goods, on 30 and 31 October at its auction yards in Johannesburg and Cape Town. "There will be more than 475 lots on offer at the combined auctions," says the auction company's Martin Dibowitz. The auction will begin in Johannesburg, with upward of 300 lots available, he adds. "Offerings on Day One will include a fleet of 2017 and 2014 Mercedes Benz Axor horses and side-tipping trailers. In addition, there will be a large selection of trucks, including water tankers, craned drop-sides, tippers and volume bodies. "On the construction side, more than 10 excavators will go under the hammer, ranging from a massive 70-ton Volvo through to a number of Komatsu 20-tonners. An unprecedented eight Caterpillar 950H wheel loaders will be flanked by two Caterpillar 966Hs and a Komatsu 480. With 10 late-model digger loaders also available, clients will be spoiled for choice." Dibowitz adds: "Perhaps the most impressive lot of the day will be the late-model Liebherr 200-ton all-terrain crane, which is also expected to be the most expensive lot of the day." The Cape Town auction, scheduled for Day Two, will include more than 175 lots. "In addition to a large number of earthmoving, construction and trucking lots for sale, the auction will offer a wide selection of small plant hire equipment from a liquidated plant hire company, and almost new refrigeration and display equipment from a liquidated confectionery outlet," he says. "Added to these, about 50 late-model, bank-owned executive vehicles will be on auction, including a fleet of low-mileage 2017 Mercedes Benz Vitos." Dibowitz adds that WH Auctioneers' customised webcast system will be available for both auctions, allowing buyers who are not able to attend these events in person to bid online in real time. The Johannesburg auction will be held at 10.30am on Tuesday, 30 October, at 578, 16th Road, Midrand. The Cape Town auction will take place at 10.30am on Wednesday, 31 October, at 17 Dacres Avenue, Epping 2. The items to be sold may be viewed on the day prior to each auction. WH Auctioneers' staff will be on hand at both auction venues to assist buyers. * For further details, visit www.whauctions.com or phone WH Auctioneers on 011 574 5700 or 021 204 0599.
