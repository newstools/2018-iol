Cape Town - One person has died and 4 000 people were displaced after a fire ravaged more than 200 wood and iron structures in Khayelitsha early on Saturday morning, Cape Town authorities said. Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service divisional commander Edward Bosch said nine fire engines, seven water tankers and a rescue vehicle with 65 firefighters were on scene to assist. The blaze was contained by 9am and Solid Waste moved in with cleaning crews. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined and rescue efforts were being hampered by gale force South-East winds, said JP Smith‚ the City of Cape Town mayoral committee member for safety and security. Disaster Management Joint Operations Centre was activated at 10 am at Goodwood Disaster Risk Management, said Smith and added that donations and relief materials could be dropped off at Khayelitsha Fire Station. * This is a developing story.
