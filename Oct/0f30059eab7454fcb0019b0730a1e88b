CAPE TOWN – Chinese phone maker Oppo has been caught and found guilty of manipulating benchmark scores for their the Find X and F7 devices by UL Benchmarks. This comes after Tech2 and UL Benchmarks decided to do more testing on the devices and found irregularities. This resulted in both devices being delisted from the 3DMark charts. “After reviewing Tech2’s benchmark results, and conducting testing in our own lab, we have decided to delist the affected models and remove them from our performance rankings,” read a UL Benchmarks post. “The Oppo Find X was ranked #4 in our list of the Best Smartphones for 3DMark Sling Shot Extreme performance. It now appears unranked, and without a score, at the bottom of our rankings. 3DMark scores from delisted devices should not be used to compare models,” the post added. In response, Oppo noted that it designed its devices to up the performance level whenever a benchmark test was detected. Additionally, Oppo has not confirmed when it will make changes to its software in order to address this issue. This isn’t the first time that a smartphone maker has been caught. HTC, Samsung and Huawei have done this in the past too.  BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
