CAPE TOWN – Ahead of its big iPad Pro and Mac event, Apple has announced in a blog post that iOS 12.1 will be released today. The new iOS 12.1 update is set to include the Group FaceTime feature that was removed from the initial release but Apple claims that the feature is ready. Group FaceTime allows you to video chat with up to 32 people simultaneously and supports stickers, video filters and Animoji/Memoji. iOS 12.1 also adds dual-SIM support for iPhone XS and XR, so you’ll be able to have two lines running on the same phone. One line will use your physical SIM card, with the other working through eSIM technology. Speaking of the camera, iOS 12.1 will allow iPhone XS/XR owners to adjust the depth of field/bokeh in the live preview of a portrait shot. Portrait mode with Depth Control is also available on the TrueDepth camera for selfies, which includes Memoji and faster face tracking support for third-party ARKit apps. See how the depth control works in the video below. WATCH:   Apple will also be adding new emojis in the update. There are over 70 and they include the following emojis: bagel emoji, new characters with red hair, grey hair and curly hair, a new emoji for bald people, more emotive smiley faces and additional emoji representing animals, sports and food.
