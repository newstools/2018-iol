CAPE TOWN – Anglo American has created a visual gallery on Instagram called INSTAMINE, with the aim of educating South Africans about how minerals are extracted from the ground. The INSTAMINE contains 132 photos and when users scroll down and follow on from the last image, they can see down the mine. “Innovation has been critical to ensuring that we find new ways to mine and process natural resources. In this regard, we are continuously evolving the way in which we share mining-related content. INSTAMINE is an opportunity to educate the public about how mining is innovating to transform itself. Majority of our followers have never experienced an underground mine, so this also acts an opportunity to shift public perceptions that mining is not what it was decades ago,” digital media specialist at Anglo American South Africa, Phakamani Lisa said in a statement. Users can see the INSTAMINE by visiting the Anglo American Instagram page.  BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
