Amman - Flash floods in Jordan swept away a school bus Thursday, killing at least 17 people, mostly pupils, emergency services said. Several more students were injured in the incident near the Dead Sea, said an official from the civil defence, Jordan's fire service, who asked not to be named. "Heavy rains caused a flash flood close to the Dead Sea that washed away a school bus carrying 37 students and seven minders," the official said. Rescue workers were continuing to search for survivors, he said. "The students were on a school trip and it appears that a mudslide along the road swept their bus away," the official said. Israel's military said it was helping with the operation, sending helicopters and search and rescue soldiers. "Currently assisting Jordan in rescuing a bus full of children swept away in a flood on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea," it wrote on Twitter. Heavy rains hit Jordan on Thursday afternoon, causing floods in several areas. The Dead Sea, the lowest point on the earth, is surrounded by steep valley slopes that frequently witness flash floods and landslides. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
