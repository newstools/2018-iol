JOHANNESBURG - Hospitality group Marriott International’s collection of independent hotels, Autograph Collection Hotels, says it will soon debut into Kenya, with Sankara Nairobi slated to join its portfolio of over 150 hotels around the world. Sankara Nairobi, owned by Westlands Hotels, is expected to be rebranded in early 2019. “Our one-of-a-kind Autograph Collection Hotels are known for providing differentiated, standout guest experiences, and we are thrilled to welcome Sankara Nairobi to our dynamic portfolio,”  Marriott International president and managing director for Middle East and Africa Alex Kyriakidis said. "We believe this hotel is a perfect fit for the brand and the rebranding is in lockstep with the growing demand from consumers and their desire for unique and differentiated experiences wherever they travel.” Strategically located in the heart of Westlands, the city’s commercial, retail and entertainment quarter, Sankara Nairobi is a short drive away from the city center and the United Nations Headquarters and within easy access from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as well as the Wilson Airport. - African News Agency (ANA)
