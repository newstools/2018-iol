  October 9, 2018    King Zwelithini is not going into this with his eyes wide open. We can NEVER form an alliance with the worst of our enemies, NEVER! He's been duped by these Dutch. — Renaît (@lerenait) 
  October 9, 2018    King Zwelithini is not protecting the land for abantu bakhe. He's simply protecting it for himself. I feel for the Zulu nation. — Mbongeni (@MGegana7)
