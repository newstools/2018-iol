Operating under its new name, EasyBiz Technologies from Monday, 15 October 2018, the organisation’s Managing Director, Gary Epstein, notes that while the business has a new name, its commitment to galvanizing small business success through the power of software technology and innovation remains unchanged. “Our new name is intended to better reflect our new identity and our passion for technology," said Epstein. “While we, of course, will be providing the same standard of service and products we always have, we are thrilled to be bringing exciting new innovations to the South African market that will support our customers and partners through the fourth industrial revolution. From expanding our cloud offerings and exploring the opportunities presented by artificial intelligence solutions, to collaborating with our partners, Intuit QuickBooks on software for the local market. We’re also investigating new ways to bridge the gap between desktop and online. In doing so we aim to ignite small business success with the introduction of innovative solutions that inspire us,” said Epstein.
