RUSTENBURG - Late iconic motswako maestro Jabulani Tsambo better known as Hip Hop Pantsula or HHP was part of the North West province's plans for the upcoming Mahika Mahikeng music festival. This was revealed by culture, arts and traditional affairs member of the executive council (MEC) Ontlametse Mochware. "The news shocked us badly as he was part of the music and arts family in our province,"  she said. "Only last month, he gave a sterling performance at the South African Traditional Music Achievement Awards (SATMA) in Mahikeng. Even sadder for us is that he was part of our plans for the upcoming Mahika Mahikeng cultural music festival. We will dearly miss him. The young man was one of the pioneers of the music that brought our province international fame – motswako. He made Setswana rap popular and opened doors for many artists from the North West.’’ Earlier, the family in a brief statement confirmed his death and requested privacy. "It is with heavy hearts that we confirm that Jabulani Tsambo, known to his fans as Hip Hop Pantsula, passed away today, Wednesday, 24 October 2018. At the time of his passing he was 38-year-old.
