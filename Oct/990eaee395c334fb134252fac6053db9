Moscow - More than 2,300 homes have been flooded in southern Russia's Krasnodar region, with six people dead and one missing, authorities said on Friday. Rivers overflowed as the region experienced rainfall this week amounting to the regular two-month average. The region, which includes the city of Sochi, hosted many of the events of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Flooding has affected about 30 population centres, the Emergency Situations Ministry said in a statement. News reports showed heavy flooding around Sochi. A highway bridge collapsed in a western part of the city, cutting off traffic. Federal investigators have opened criminal negligence cases into the deaths of an elderly man and woman believed to have died because of the flooding. Investigations are under way to establish the cause of death of four others who died amid the inundation, the Investigative Committee said in a statement. Another elderly woman has been reported missing, the committee said. dpa
