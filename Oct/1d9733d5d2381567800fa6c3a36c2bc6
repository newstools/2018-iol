CAPE TOWN - A forensic report paints a grim picture of Patricia de Lille's term as mayor of Cape Town and points to misconduct on her part, the Democratic Alliance said on Tuesday. Natasha Mazzone, the deputy chairwoman of the DA's federal executive, said the report would be tabled at a meeting of the city council on Thursday and asked De Lille not to pre-empt the matter. Media reports have said that the report recommends that disciplinary action be taken against the former mayor, who will step down at the end of the month after a bruising year-long battle with the party over allegations of corruption within the council. Mazzone said it should be noted that there were two reports on strife within the city council, and that both "by all accounts point to continuous interference and misconduct by Patricia de Lille. "The second more substantive report, which by all accounts includes 2000 pages of detailed evidence, based on interviews, legal submissions and other inputs paints a grim picture of Patricia de Lilleâ€™s conduct as mayor." Mazzone said the party would await Thursday's meeting to deal with the report. "We would be hopeful that Ms de Lille and her associates do not seek to confuse the public any further on this matter."
