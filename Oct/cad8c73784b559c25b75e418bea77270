Kampala — Kanye West has met with Uganda's president during a visit to the East African nation and given the 74-year-old leader a pair of white sneakers. President Yoweri Museveni said he and the American rapper held "fruitful discussions" on Monday about promoting tourism and arts. West and his wife, reality TV star Kim Kardashian West, have been vacationing in a national park in Uganda. He is said to be recording music in a tent. Uganda’s presidency released photos of a hoodie-wearing West meeting Museveni at the State House on Monday and exchanging gifts. While excited tourism officials see the visit as an endorsement of the country's tourism potential, some Ugandans wryly pointed out that Museveni cracked down on hoodies earlier this year when he announced that motorcycle riders could no longer wear them in a bid to fight rising crime. The president, one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, has been at the centre of unrest in recent weeks as Uganda's large youth population increasingly expresses frustration over unemployment and accuses Museveni of being out of touch. Uganda's government has been criticised over its treatment of a local pop star-turned-opposition lawmaker, Bobi Wine, who alleges torture by security forces. The government denies it. Associated Press
