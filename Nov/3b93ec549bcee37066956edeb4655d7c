CAPE TOWN – A recent patent updated suggests that Sony might be creating a PS4 controller that would replace the DualShock 4’s touch-sensitive control pad with a touchscreen. Spotted by The Verge, the patent was filed to the United States Patent Office and the very technical and length patent suggest that it could be an updated version of the DualShock 4, or maybe could be a hint at the PlayStation 5’s controller. However, the main point is that the indication of a touchscreen is something to take note of. The abstract of the patent reads as follows: “A controller for interfacing wirelessly with a computing device is provided, including the following: a housing defined by a main body, a first extension extending from a first end of the main body, and a second extension extending from a second end of the main body, the first extension and the second extension for holding by a first hand and a second hand of a user, respectively; a touchscreen defined along the top surface of the main body between the first extension and the second extension; a first set of buttons disposed on the top surface of the main body proximate to the first extension and on a first side of the touchscreen; and a second set of buttons disposed on the top surface of the main body proximate to the second extension and on a second side of the touchscreen.” BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
