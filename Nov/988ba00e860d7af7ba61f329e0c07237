Parliament - Former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba has resigned as an ANC Member of Parliament. The speaker's office in Parliament confirmed on Thursday that Gigaba had submitted his resignation letter. Gigaba's departure from Parliament follows his resignation as a minister earlier this week. Meanwhile, Speaker Baleka Mbete said she had referred President Cyril Ramaphosa's letter and the Public Protector's report, which found against Gigaba, to Parliament's joint committee on ethics and members interests and to the home affairs committee. Calls mounted for Gigaba to resign after he was embroiled in scandal, regarding the legal action between himself and the Oppenheimers over the VVIP terminal. The Gauteng High Court ruled that Gigaba had lied under oath over the matter. The minister was dealt a blow when the Constitutional Court dismissed his application to appeal the high court ruling. The court said the case was unlikely to succeed. This was the second blow for Gigaba after the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Gigaba violated the constitution and the executive ethics code when he told untruths under oath in court. A video of Gigaba performing a sexual act on himself - which he says was stolen when his phone was hacked - has also been widely circulated on social media, drawing strong criticism from opposition parties. Following his resignation as a minister, Gigaba said that his departure should not be viewed as an admission of guilt. He plans to take Mkhwebane's report on a court review.
