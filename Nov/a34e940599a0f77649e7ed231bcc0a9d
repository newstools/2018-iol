Johannesburg - Football legend Mike Mangena, 58, who was arrested after a drug manufacturing bust on his property last week, was granted R50 000 bail on Monday at the Randfontein Magistrate's Court. The former Kaizer Chiefs star, who is facing charges related to the unlawful manufacture of illicit drugs, was nabbed on Wednesday with three other suspects. Police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili last week explained the events leading to the arrests at the clandestine drug laboratory on a smallholding in Randfontein. "The search warrant was effected in the early hours of this morning and the Team discovered a steel shed full of chemicals and machines used to manufacture Mandrax as well as a truck containing liquid chemicals. Forensic Science Laboratory crime scene investigators are currently at the scene collecting evidence. Muridili added that the value of the lab would be determined by forensics as soon as they complete their analyses. Acting National Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Stefan Schutte commended the team on the arrests. “Drugs ravage our communities and destroy the future of our children. As we will soon commemorate the 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Children, we all need to take extra care of our children by ridding our communities of drugs”, he said.
