CAPE TOWN ‚Äì Takealot started their blue dot sale for Black Friday today at midnight on 23 November but according to their customers, the company didn't provide a great experience thus far. Takealot customers have taken to¬†Twitter¬†to complain about numerous issues such as problems with paying for their items on the website, some consumers found that they were charging more for the item today than a few days ago and complaints came through with the website not being responsive. Users stated that the website crashed at the payment screen after they had clicked pay, and on certain occasions funds still came off their account. The company was responding to certain users on Twitter to try and help them resolve their issues. In response to the checkout issue, TakeAlot said on Twitter: "We've disabled the Credit Card and Masterpass payment options until our payment partner has restored their service. Please try using one of our other payment methods like Instant EFT via I-Pay in the meantime." Over an hour later, the company said that the service was up and running again. "The Credit Card and Masterpass payment options have been reactivated on our platforms. Please feel free to use your credit card or any of our other payment options, like Instant EFT to complete your purchase. Thank you," said Takealot. Julie-Anne Walsh, Chief Marketing Officer at Takealot.com said ‚ÄúAll of the preparation done for the enormous increase in shoppers has paid-off and the site performed well, staying online. Thousands of Blue Dot Sale deals are still available for shoppers to take advantage of over the entire Blue Dot Sale weekend. ‚Äù Walsh added that¬†Intermittent technical issues with Takealot‚Äôs credit card payment provider resulted in some customers experiencing difficulties with credit card transactions but this has since been fixed.
