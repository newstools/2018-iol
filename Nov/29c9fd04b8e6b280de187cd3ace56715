Pretoria - DA members are planning to picket outside the Pretoria Magistrate's Court, where Nicholas Ninow is scheduled to appear for allegedly raping a child at a Dros restaurant. DA national spokesperson Refiloe Nt’sekhe and DA Women’s Network Tshwane regional chairperson, Mpho Mehlape will lead the picket. Ninow, 20, faces charges of rape, possession of drugs, assault with intent to do bodily harm and intimidation. It is alleged that he followed the 7-year-old girl from the Silverton restaurant's play area to the toilets where he raped her. The girl's mother allegedly caught him in the act after she went looking for her child. "South Africa is among the countries with the highest rape incidents. Children and women in our country are not safe and more must be done to protect them," the party said. "We must stand united against the scourge of rape and sexual assault to ensure the most vulnerable people in our society can live without fear." IOL
