Pretoria - The Department of Correctional Services said former Paralympian, Oscar Pistorius was granted compassionate leave to attend a memorial service for his late grandfather on Tuesday. "This request was processed in accordance with the Departmental Policy on Amenities of Inmates, where compassionate leave is granted for the attendance of funerals and/or a serious sick­ness where it is expected that the person is dying. This concession is only granted when it concerns a direct family member - father, mother, child, spouse, bro­ther, sister, grandfather and grandmother," said correctional services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo. "Inmates can apply for compassionate leave and must be considered by the head of centre taking into consideration the criteria which list a number of variables. These include but not limited to, an inmate classified as low risk, demonstrate good behaviour and be actively involved in rehabilitation programmes." Nxumalo said Pistorius was escorted to the memorial service and has since returned to the correctional centre.
