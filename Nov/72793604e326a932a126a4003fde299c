Lagos - Suspected members of Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram have killed at least eight people in north-eastern Nigeria, officials and witnesses said Thursday. The extremists attacked several villages as well as a refugee camp near Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, late Wednesday, according to National Emergency Management Agency coordinator Bahsir Garga. "The terrorists gained access to the area through a bush path behind the villages and came in four vehicles and some motorcycles," said Garga. While Garga placed the death toll at eight, witnesses told dpa they had counted 13 bodies. Several other people were injured in the attacks, according to Abu Abdulsalam, a resident of Kofa, one of the affected villages. As part of the attack, the gunmen burnt down parts of the village, Abdulsalam added. The military confirmed the attacks on Thursday, but did not put forward a death toll. Boko Haram poses a steady threat to communities in north-eastern Nigeria and has also launched offensives in neighbouring Chad, Niger and Cameroon. Since 2009, tens of thousands of people have died at the hands of the Sunni fundamentalists - whose goal is to enforce a strict interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia - and an estimated 2.5 million people fled their homes. dpa
