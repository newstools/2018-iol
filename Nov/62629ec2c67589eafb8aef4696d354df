Mahikeng - The funeral service for motswako rapper Jabulani Tsambo, better known as Hip Hop Pantsula (HHP), is taking place in Mmabatho, Mahikeng in North West on Saturday. On Friday night Jabba arrived at the Mmabatho Unit 5 home in blaring of sirens following the High Court in Johannesburg ruling that his funeral could proceed in Mahikeng. Tsambo's partner Lerato Sengadi approached the court in a bid to halt the funeral. She argued that she is Tsambo's customary wife and has a right to bury him, following a statement by the musician's father that Sengadi was not recognised as his late son's wife as she was never handed over to the Tsambo family in any form of a ceremony. WATCH THE LIVE FEED:   Judge Ratha Mokgoatleng ruled that Sengadi is the customary wife to HPP but denied her interdict to stop the funeral in Mahikeng. Jabba died on October 24,Â 2018, at his Johannesburg home aged 38. He will be laid to rest at the Heroes Acre at the Mmabatho cemetery. African News Agency (ANA)
