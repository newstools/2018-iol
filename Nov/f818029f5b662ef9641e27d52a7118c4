Rustenburg - The head of the North West health department Dr Thabo Lekalakala has been placed on precautionary suspension, the department said on Thursday. His suspension followed his reinstatement on his post on Monday after a court ruled that he could return to work. He was suspended in April and put on special leave after his suspension lapsed. "This precautionary suspension follows his return to work on 19 November 2018 after the arbitration outcome which nullified his special leave," said spokesperson Tebogo Lekgethwane. "The precautionary suspension is based on the nature and seriousness of allegations levelled against him as well as the ongoing disciplinary hearing which is scheduled for 11 and 12 December 2018." He said Dr Lekalakala, was facing allegations of procurement irregularities and misrepresentation. "The precautionary suspension is also necessitated by a need to avoid possible interference with disciplinary processes and service delivery. This is in terms of Chapter 7 of the Senior Management Handbook." Lekalakala returned to work on Monday but was confronted by toyi-toyi workers who wanted him fired. He has been charged with procurement irregularities for his involvement in the Gupta-linked Mediosa company and misrepresentation of facts after he stated that he had worked as the chief director. He had allegedly paid Mediosa R30m upfront for a mobile clinic. African News Agency (ANA)
