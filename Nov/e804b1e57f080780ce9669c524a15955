"We are pleased with our year to date performance, and we remain confident that our resilient business model, tight expense control, the measures we have taken to ensure we remain relevant and competitive, as well as increased volumes in certain sectors and acquisitions, will enable us to deliver acceptable growth in FY19," chief executive Lindsay Ralphs said in a trading update. "Our sound financial position and strong balance sheet provides adequate headroom to support our growth and investment aspirations, both locally and internationally."
