RUSTENBURG - A minibus taxi was torched on Wednesday in an apparent conflict between taxi associations and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) in Marikana, North West police said. "According to my information it seems like there is a bit of a conflict between Amcu and two taxi associations. One of the taxi owners felt threatened and ran off, leaving his taxi near the road [where] it was torched,"Â  said Colonel Adele Myburgh. It was not clear what triggered the conflict. According to social media, about 100 minibus taxis blocked Bapotrans bus depot, in an attempt to stop the buses from transporting workers to various Lonmin shafts. The bus company owned by Bapo Ba Mogale has been contracted to transport mineworkers but the taxis wanted to transport the workers. The minibus was torched near Lonmin's Karee 4 belt mine. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. African News Agency (ANA)
