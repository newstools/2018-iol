Tunis - Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived Tuesday in Tunisia, where hundreds of people have been protesting the visit over the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The crown prince was received by Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi. Mohammed's visit is part of a tour of several Arab countries, his first trip abroad since Khashoggi - a sharp critic of Mohammed - was killed inside a Saudi consulate in Turkey on October 2, triggering global condemnations. Saudi officials have repeatedly denied reports that the prince is linked to the murder. Hundreds of people gathered earlier on Tuesday on Habib Bourguiba avenue in the capital Tunis and chanted slogans calling for the overthrow of the crown prince. They raised pictures of children killed in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and other Sunni allies, including the United Arab Emirates, have been leading a military campaign against the Shiite Houthi rebels since March 2015. "Bin Salman, you are a murderer," some chanted while carrying Yemeni flags. On Monday, activists staged a protest on the same avenue against the visit. Twelve Tunisian civic and rights groups, among them a journalists' union, voiced their opposition at a press conference. The journalists' union has hung a banner on its building showing an image of the crown prince holding a bone saw and reading "no to the desecration of Tunisia." Prince Mohammed's current tour comes ahead of his participation in the G20 summit in Argentina, starting on Friday. During his tour, he visited the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.
