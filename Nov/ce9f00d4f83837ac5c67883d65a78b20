We also announced a shopping channel in Explore, a dedicated space for you to shop from the brands you follow as well as brands you have yet to discover. "Today, we’re announcing three new ways to discover new products, shop from your favourite brands and keep track of all your shopping inspiration in one place on Instagram. Just in time for the holidays." Here are the three new updates: Shopping collections Users will soon be able to shop videos they see in their feed; save items to a specific “shopping collection” in their saved posts and also shop business profiles more easily. The features all point to Instagram creating a more fully formed experience where users can do a large portion of their shopping through the platform, just in time for the holidays this year. The new shopping collection area in saved posts are all arranged in neat rows so you can scroll through whatever you saved in the event that you want to buy it now. Only certain posts are considered shopping posts on Instagram. Shop on business profiles  the company will also be testing a redesign of the Shop tab on business profiles so that users can quickly view all the products featured in their shopping posts. When users visit a business profile, tap on the ‘Shop’ button to see their products, such as the item name, price, and the post featuring the item. Shopping in Feed videos  You can now shop in videos from your favourite brands. When you see a video in Feed from a brand you follow, tap the shopping icon in the bottom left corner to reveal the featured products and learn more about them. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
