Cape Town - Former Democratic Alliance Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille on Sunday announced she will be launching a new political party soon. De Lille, who hung up her mayoral chain last month following months of bitter infighting between her, members of her mayoral committee, and leaders of the DA, said the new party's name and polities would be unveiled in another two weeks' time. "We will be launching a new political party that will contest the 2019 elections in all nine provinces. Our party will be putting people before politics," she said. "Our party will build a better country for the next generation and educate our children so that they can liberate themselves. We will be a part of less talk and more action," De Lille said.
