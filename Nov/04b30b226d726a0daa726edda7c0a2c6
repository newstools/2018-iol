PARLIAMENT - Five more grounded aircraft from South African Express (SAX) should return to service in December, the department of public enterprises said on Wednesday. In a briefing to parliament's portfolio committee on public enterprises, acting director general Thuto Shomang, said this would see "at 13 aircraft at least in full operation" out of the regional airline's fleet of 21 planes by the end of the year. In May, the South African Civil Aviation Authority grounded South African Express and revoked its maintenance approvals because of serious safety concerns. Eight aircraft have so far been returned to service after the airline implemented corrective measures. Earlier this year in October, SA Express announced its return to service to two of its critical routes to the coastal town of Walvis Bay in Namibia as well as Hoedspruit in Mpumalanga. Both flights depart from Johannesburg. The Johannesburg – Hoedspruit flights have been effective from 11 October 2018 while the Johannesburg – Walvis Bay flights resumed on 24 September 2018. - African News Agency (ANA)
