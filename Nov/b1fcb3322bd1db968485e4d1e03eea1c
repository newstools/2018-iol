CAPE TOWN – The South African Revenue Service (Sars) on Friday announced that South Africa’s trade deficit widened to R5.5 billion in October from R3.8bn in September. Investec economist Lara Hodes said in month-to-month terms the larger deficit position was driven by a 9.7 percent lift in imports ahead of the 8.5 percent rise in the export category. “An analysis of the underlying trade data, indicates that gains within the key export categories was broad based, with only the vegetable products segment reflecting a -30 percent month-on-month dip. Similarly, the import component of the trade balance logged gains across most sectors, with the outlier being mineral products which slid by 7 percent month on month,” said Hodes Sars said the year-to-date trade deficit of R8.82bn was a deterioration on the surplus for the comparable period in 2017 of R48.94bn. Exports year-to-date increased by 6.6 percent while imports for the same period showed an increase of 13.3 percent. Including trade data with Botswana, eSwatini, Lesotho and Namibia:   Looking forward, Hodes said an elevation in trade tensions could further dampen global trade activity and while import growth would likely be restricted by the moderation in the international oil price and restrained rates of domestic consumption, we could see the trade account recording a deficit position for the next few months.
