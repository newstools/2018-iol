Cape Town - As the United Nations and the global community mark World Toilet Day, 'Michelle R', known as Spacedoutdesigns, has found a creative way to clean your toilets. For $23.50 (about R328), the "Commander in Crap: Donald Trump toilet brush" is being sold on Etsy at an alarming rate.  As the ad says, it's all in a bid to "Make toilets great again". The handmade item is so popular that the arrival time for the orders placed after November 15 takes 6 to 8 weeks. So unfortunately, it cannot be considered as Christmas gift but may arrive in time for a Valentine's Day gift to an ex. If you aren't already sold on the idea, Spacedoutdesigns takes a few jabs at Trump and writes: "Make Your Toilet Great Again! No president has had a Toilet Brush like my Toilet Brush! I am automatically attracted to toilet bowls, I just start scrubbing, I just kiss, I don't even wait and when your a toilet brush they let you do it. "Just Grab them by the handle...for those tough cleaning jobs." Features include a 38cm brush with holder, Trump hands "actual size" and the seller boasts that the Commander in crap may appear useful when scrubbing the rim. The seller has noted that it is for external use only.
