INTERNATIONAL – Multiple reports have suggested that WhatsApp will soon be showing adverts in the app’s Status feature. WhatsApp Vice President Chris Daniels told journalist in India from the Economic Times that the ads would count towards the “primary monetisation mode for the company”. The company will offer an opportunity for businesses to reach people, but no rollout timeline was given, according to the reports. This decision to place ads comes after WhatsApp launched its Business API in the same month. Businesses are able to respond to clients through the API for free for up to 24 hours, after which WhatsApp will charge a fixed rate per message. Recently, WhatsApp launched sticker packs that both Android and iOS users can use when communicating through the app. The sticker packs will include stickers from WhatsApp designers as well as a selection of stickers from other artists. WhatsApp has also added support for third-party stickers that will allow designers and developers to create their own stickers too. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
