INTERNATIONAL – Verge, Ethereum and Bitcoin are expected to be the most successful cryptocurrencies in November, ending two months of limited price fluctuations in the market. The experts on personal finance comparison site finder.com’s latest monthly Cryptocurrency Predictions Survey predict Verge to lead the way, with a rise of 76 percent by December 1, 2018. This is followed by Ethereum and Bitcoin, at 32 percent and 29 percent, respectively. It’s not good news for every coin though, as Tron is expected to see a fall over the next month. Despite the experts predicting a bright 2019 for the coin – 80 percent growth – they believe its value will drop by 10 percent in November. Looking ahead to 2019, XRP, Ethereum and EOS are the coins expected to see the biggest price rise. XRP is forecast to experience the greatest growth at 327 percent, followed closely by Ethereum at 211 percent and EOS at 189 percent. While the panellists believe EOS will see only slight growth over the next month with a 13 percent rise, they’re confident that it will increase at a faster rate in 2019. Bitcoin is also set to experience steady growth over the next year, with an average predicted value of $16 732 by the end of 2019. This would mean the currency would be nearing levels the coin reached at its peak in January of 2018. The panellists suggest that while bitcoin has appeared to stabilise recently, it is difficult to predict it’s value with great certainty due to the Exchange Traded Fund and BAKKT cryptocurrency exchange announcement on the way before December 1, 2018. The only coin that the experts believe will drop in value over the course of 2019 is Bytecoin. They foresee a brief rise of 3 percent this month, but an overall decline of 5 percent next year.
