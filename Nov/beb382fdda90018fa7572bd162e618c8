JOHANNESBURG â€“ In the latest report released by Viceroy, incredible accusations are made. The share price of NEPI Rockcastle, dropped by at least 9.87 percent by midday on Wednesday, shortly after the report was released. The company track record over the last year shows a dramatic drop in value:   If the report is correct and that the results published is not a true reflection of the income and expenses, then perhaps there is more down side. However, if the numbers as published in the results for the year to June hold true, then the bears are in for a proper hiding.   It would take a fool or a gambler to enter into a short sale at this point. The same would be true for an investor to go long at this level, unless they have absolute clarity of the facts. It is very disappointing in the light of the Steinhoff debacle that a listed entity with a market capitalisation of R66bn is trading under such a cloud.
