Kampala - Ugandan officials do not expect to find more survivors after a crowded boat capsized on Lake Victoria on the weekend, with dozens more feared dead than the official count of 34 killed. Twenty-six people were rescued, but authorities believe the over-packed boat was carrying more than 100 people. "We suspended the search Monday and we are resuming tomorrow. But at this time, we do not expect any survivors. None," police deputy spokesman Patrick Onyango told dpa on Wednesday. The government said a day of national mourning would be held on Friday. Flags will fly at half-staff for the victims of the marine accident - one of the worst in the East African country's history. The accident occurred on Saturday night near Mutima beach about 20 kilometres south of the capital Kampala, with police blaming the disaster on overloading and the vessel's poor mechanical condition. Boat accidents are common on Uganda's numerous lakes due to overloading, bad weather and old vessels.
