Johannesburg - The ANC has labelled the EFF's attack on Pravin Gordhan and the state capture inquiry as a form of "Trumpism" and a demon that needs to be "defeated". The ANC's head of presidency Zizi Kodwa told journalists outside the inquiry on Friday that the EFF's attack on the commission is being used to undermine its work and its effort to get to the root of the state capture phenomenon. He likened the EFF's sudden attacks to those that have characterised by US President Donald Trump's nationalistic and right-wing politics. "We have seen the act of comrade Pravin Gordhan. It is being used to undermine the commission and the witnesses that are yet to come before the commission. We think this is an element of what we call Trumpism. Trumpism thrives on three elements; firstly on fear, hate but also on race polarisation and insults which are vulgar," said Kodwa. Kodwa's comments follow days after EFF leader Julius Malema's address to his supporters who were protesting outside the inquiry on Tuesday and Monday. Malema called the commission a "Micky Mouse show". Malema attacked commission chairperson deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo and accused him of presiding over a commission that was stealing from the poor by renting an expensive building to host the commission. â€œHow does Judge Zondo sleep at night knowing that he is presiding over a commission that is stealing the money of the poor," asked Malema. Kodwa said the EFF's campaign should be stopped as it could undermine democracy especially the party's use of race-bate politics to stir-up anger amongst its base. "We must unite all South Africans both black and white to defeat the demon that is Trumpism. If we were to allow Trumpism to thrive then it will undermine our democracy," said Kodwa. "The ANC appreciates the work being done by the commission. We want this commission to unearth the rot of corruption so that we can know what needs to be done to clean the state-owned enterprises," said Kodwa. Politics Hub
