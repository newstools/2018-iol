Washington - The man accused of sending pipe bombs last week to prominent Democrats and other critics of President Donald Trump agreed Friday to have his trial moved from Florida to New York. Cesar Sayoc, 56, accepted the change during a court appearance in Miami, according to a court document. He could spend dozens of years behind bars if convicted. Sayoc, who was arrested on October 26 in the midst of a nationwide manhunt, was remanded in custody on Monday and will remain jailed. On Friday, he agreed to the prosecution's request to transfer the case to New York, where he is expected to seek release on bond. More than a dozen bomb-like devices were sent to critics of Trump, including former president Barack Obama and cable news broadcaster CNN. The mailings touched off fears of political violence ahead of the upcoming midterm elections on Tuesday. Prosecutors want to move the case to New York because several of the bombs Sayoc is alleged to have mailed were delivered to addresses in the state. None of the devices exploded. The five federal charges he will face in New York include mailing explosives and threatening former presidents. It is not clear when he will be sent up to New York to face the charges, and no trial date has been set. Among the other top Democrats and Trump critics, Sayoc is charged with targeting are former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, former vice president Joe Biden, billionaire George Soros, and actor Robert De Niro. dpa
