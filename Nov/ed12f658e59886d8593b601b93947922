Bogota, Colombia - The widow of Pablo Escobar fell madly in love as a preteen with the man who would rise to be a ruthless drug lord, but she says in a new book she felt raped when he forced her to have an abortion at age 14. Over time, she came to view him as a cruel psychopath. In the memoir, Maria Henao for the first time opens up about her life alongside the Medellin cartel boss, portraying herself more as a victim than as an accomplice to his lawbreaking. Henao describes being taken by Escobar to a ramshackle clinic and lying on a stretcher while a woman inserted tubes into her womb. She endured several days of bleeding and pain and saw the experience as a "violation." At the height of his career, Escobar's cartel supplied around 80 percentÂ of the cocaine trafficked into the United States, earning him a personal income in excess of $21 billion. He was gunned down in Medellin, Colombia, in 1993. AP and IOL
