Johannesburg - The EFF is demanding that Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan should resign as he gives testimony at the state capture inquiry. EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu accused Gordhan of being an enabler of state capture. Shivambu was addressing hundreds of the party’s supporters outside the inquiry in Parktown on Monday. Gordhan is testifying at inquiry. Shivambu accused Gordhan of colluding with Eskom board chair Jabu Mabuza to compromise the power utility. He also made sweeping statements about Gordhan’s management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Shivambu said the party would expose Gordhan just like it did with former president Jacob Zuma and former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene. The party has reported Gordhan to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane for “lying” to Parliament. The party's complaint stems from a question it had posed in Parliament to Gordhan in 2016 regarding whether any of National Treasury's staff members had met with the Gupta family. It was the revelation that Gordhan had met with an Indian businessman, who had an interest in buying a stake in MTN, that has rattled the EFF. The party said he was not honest about this meeting and that he should have revealed this information as part of his answer to the party's question in Parliament. Gordhan violated the executive ethics code and his oath of office when he lied to parliament, said the EFF. Shivambu promised that EFF supporters would be back on Tuesday to picket outside the inquiry while Gordhan continues with his testimony. Politics Hub
