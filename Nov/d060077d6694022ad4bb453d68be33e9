Rustenburg - Renowned rap musician Jabulani Tsambo, better known as HHP, was buried at his hometown of Mahikeng in the North West on Saturday. He was buried at the Hero's Acre section of the Matlalong Cemetery in Mmabatho. The acclaimed rapper received a fitting farewell, with North West premier Job Mokgoro describing him as a "social poet and revolutionary". Tsambo, also known as Jabba, was one of the musicians who formed part of rebuilding societal morality, which was clear in his lyrics. "Let us not allow the passing of Jabulani to be in vain. Let us all work together to preserve his legacy by committing all our efforts to make this a better world," Mokgoro said at the motswako maestro's funeral service at the Mmabatho Convention Centre. The premier said that through his song, Harambe, HHP had appreciated the freedom South Africans enjoyed today. Mokgoro had mourners on their feet when he voiced lyrics from Harambe. Born Jabulani Tsambo on September 14, 1980, he died on October 24 at his Johannesburg home aged 38. He had been known to suffer depression.            His customary wife Lerato Sengadi attended the funeral serviceÂ but seemed to be snubbed throughout. Speaker after speaker did not recognise her until a pastor took to the stage and mentioned her. Sengadi earlier approached the High Court in Johannesburg on an urgent basis seeking an interdict to halt the funeral. She argued that she was the customary wife to HHP and had been excluded in the funeral arrangements of her husband.      This came after HHP's father Robert Tsambo denied that his son was customarily married to her, arguing that she was never handed over to the Tsambo family in any form of ceremony. Judge Ratha Mokgoatleng ruled that Sengadi was HHP's customary wife, but denied her an interdict to halt the funeral in Mahikeng. African News Agency (ANA)
