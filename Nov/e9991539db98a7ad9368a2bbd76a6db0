JOHANNESBURG - The city of Cape Town said on Monday it had made good progress with the R194 million Kommetjie road project which aims to relieve congestion in the area. Apart from ongoing improvements to the road infrastructure, local residents have also benefitted from temporary work opportunities. The Kommetjie project, part of the city’s congestion management programme, is due for completion by the end of 2019. Approximately R100 million of the R194 million budget has been spent to date.  Up to 45 local residents are currently employed as temporary workers and more than R5.1 million has been paid out to such men and women since the project started in October 2016. "Local subcontractors have also benefitted – to date over R2.1 million has been spent on the procurement of goods and services from local businesses," Cape Town mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Felicity Purchase said. The Kommetjie project entails roadworks covering approximately 3.5 km, including the upgrade of the road to a four-lane dual-carriageway between Capri Drive and Corsair Way, and the rehabilitation of the existing roadway. It will also see the upgrade of Ou Kaapse road to a four-lane dual-carriageway between Noordhoek Main road and Kommetjie road.  - African News Agency (ANA)
