CAPE TOWN – WhatsApp may soon introduce two new ways to add contacts on the app that are QR code-based tools. This is according to a WABetaInfo report, which states that the company has reportedly been working on these new features for weeks, adding improvements in recent updates.     Boom! Spotted new WhatsApp QR Code and "Add Contact" features on IOS and Android, under development!https://t.co/NjmSleCeRT The first tool will be a QR code option in the Add Contact menu, allowing users to simply scan a QR code and automatically add the contact to their application. Users will also be able to share their own QR code. This will then eliminate the need for physically taking down a cellphone number. The company will also be adding the ability to users to add new contacts from within WhatsApp itself instead of having to navigate out of the app and into their device’s phone book. These features are not yet available on the iOS or Android versions of WhatsApp. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
