The South African currency strengthened in line with improved emerging market sentiment on the back of hopes that the US and China are making some progress in resolving their trade dispute. The rand was stable despite a parliamentary committee recommending that the Constitution be amended to allow for land expropriation without compensation for economic redress. At the close of local trade, the rand quoted 0.5 percent stronger at R14.25/$, after trading in the range of R14.21/$ - R14.40/$. The rand traded stronger overnight. Expected range today R14.00/$ - R14.30/$.

In the overall emerging market sphere, the MSCI Emerging Market Index (+1.31 percent) traded higher. In local news, Woolworths (-0.34 percent) released a trading statement that showed a 2.7 percent y-o-y increase in sales for the 20 weeks ended November 11 on the back of solid performance in local food and Australian businesses.

At the close of local trade, the Brent oil price quoted 1.1 percent higher/lower at $66.76/pb. Crude prices continued to climb slightly higher during Asian trade this morning.
