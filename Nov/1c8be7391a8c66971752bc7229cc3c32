This startup develops chatbots to help financial service providers acquire and retain customers through Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered conversations. FinChatBot has demonstrated in less than two years that the acquisition of new customers via automated chat conversation has a much higher success rate than any other channel. FinChatBot will use the investment to continue their rapid growth and expand their impressive client pipeline. Antoine Paillusseau and Romain Diaz, FinChatBot cofounders, identified the opportunity to use chatbots to meet the expectations of customers globally for services that are available 24/7. FinChatBot promises to significantly lower the drop off rate traditionally experienced by customers who engage with a call centre. Founded in 2016, FinChatBot has developed and services chatbot experiences for more than 10 top tiers insurers & banks in South Africa. Paillusseau said, "By implementing our chatbots, financial services providers are able to increase their conversion rates, reduce operational costs and gather more data about customers which can be used for product innovation and customer retention".
