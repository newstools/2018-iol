CAPE TOWN – Seedstars World, the largest seed-stage startup competition for emerging markets and fast-growing startup scenes, brought its South Africa round of events to a successful close during Seedstars South Africa Finals. The event took place this Wednesday 14th, at Seedspace Cape Town, and seven selected startups were invited to present their companies in front of the local jury panel. The local winner, Franc Group, a self-insurance platform that gives its users the opportunity to grow their wealth, was named “Best Startup in South Africa” for its innovative sustainable solution. “I am overwhelmed and honoured. We're very aware of the quality of companies that have come before us. It's filled the team with confidence and motivation to crack on - there's still lots to do. We're also very grateful to Seedstars, the judges, PayFast and also humbled by the other great companies that pitched alongside us," said Thomas Brennan, Founder at Franc Group.
