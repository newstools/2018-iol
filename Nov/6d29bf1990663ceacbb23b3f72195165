The Budget Review provides additional information on the tax proposals made in the Budget and proposed changes to tax legislation. “Major tax policy proposals are contained in Chapter 4 of the Budget Review and the more technical tax proposals are generally contained in Annexure C of the Budget Review,” the Treasury said. To ensure proper assessment, technical tax proposals should be submitted under the following headings:   The Treasury said each technical tax proposal must be explained in detail with each explanation covering the following areas:   “In order to clarify issues raised in the submitted technical proposals and to further assist in the prioritisation of the issues raised, workshops will be held with stakeholders on 6 and 7 December 2018 where further information is required. “The dates for the workshops will be confirmed by way of an electronic invitation to taxpayers, tax practitioners and members of the public. Please ensure that correct e-mail addresses and contact information are included in the written submissions,” the Treasury said. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
