Johannesburg - The two suspects - 27-year-old Ernest Mabaso and 61-year-old Fita Khupe - accused of the murder of seven family members of the Khoza family at their Vlakfontein home will spend the week behind bars after Magistrate Maggie Van Der Merwe postponed the matter on Monday. Mabaso, who allegedly masqueraded as Sibusiso Khoza in order to gain access to the family, has abandoned his bail application. Khupe will apply for bail on Monday next week. The bodies were discovered last week at the family home. They had been concealed under piles of sand inside the house. Mabaso and Khupe face multiple charges of rape, robbery, and murder. Both accused, who were arrested at the weekend, will remain in police custody. Earlier on Monday, African National Congress Women's League were picketing outside court in an effort to discourage the magistrate from granting bail to the accused.      ANCWL members said they were angry and hurt. They warned that if the court ignored their wishes to deny the suspects bail, they would take the law into their own hands and mete out justice as they see it fit. African News Agency/ANA
