JOHANNESBURG – Disgraced former Transnet chief executive Brian Molefe and chief financial officer Anoj Singh have been found to have lied to the company's board, with the lies having cost the group billions of rand. A forensic report into Transnet found Molefe and Singh misrepresented facts to the Transnet board by indicating R38.6 billion excluded potential effects from forex and hedging will be needed to procure 1 064 locomotives. "The misrepresentation by Molefe and Singh contributed to the increase in escalations, forex and contingencies ETC by at least R6.7 billion," reads the report. Investigators further found that the total Transnet Engineering (TE) scope allocated for the acquisition of the 1 064 locomotives was R7.5 billion.
