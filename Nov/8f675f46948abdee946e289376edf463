CAPE TOWN – Microsoft announced that the Xbox One keyboard and mouse support will be arriving on consoles this week starting November 14th.      Microsoft has partnered with gaming hardware Razer to enable keyboard and mouse support on the Xbox One which was revealed back in September. Jason Ronald, Director of Program Management for Xbox Platform said: " It’s important to note that mouse and keyboard support for games is added on a title-by-title basis, entirely at developers’ discretion. For all other titles, nothing changes. Mouse and keyboard input is not enabled by default for games. Each development team knows their titles best and we support them in creating the right experience for their games as they see fit, to ensure an optimal and fair gaming experience. Warframe will be one of the first titles testing mouse and keyboard input when the feature arrives to Insider in the coming weeks." Xbox One will support keyboard and mouse in 14 games with Fortnite and Warframe being the biggest names to offer the support at launch While there are 14 confirmed games, only seven of them will be available during the initial launch of the keyboard and mouse feature.
