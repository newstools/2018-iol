The High Court in Johannesburg ruled on Friday, that his funeral should proceed in Mahikeng, this was after his partner Lerato Sengadi approached the court on an urgent basis to stop the funeral. Judge Ratha Mokgoatleng denied her an interdict to stop the funeral in Mahikeng, but ruled that she was his customary wife. "The fact that a customary marriage was not registered does not mean it is not valid,"  he said. HHP’s father Robert Tsambo argument that Sengadi was not his son’s customary wife because she was not handed over to Tsambo family in any form of ceremony, but the court dismissed his stance. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
