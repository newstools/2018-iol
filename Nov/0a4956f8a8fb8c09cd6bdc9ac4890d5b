Police spokesperson André Traut said the arrests had been made soon after seven armed people had robbed a shopkeeper in Ottery Road at about 8pm on Wednesday and sped off in a Toyota Avanza. “Seven suspects entered a shop in Ottery Road and threatened the shopkeeper and his staff with firearms,” he said. “They fled the scene in a Toyota Avanza with cash, cellphones, cold drinks and sweets. “The police were quick to respond and the getaway vehicle was spotted, which resulted in a high-speed car chase.” The vehicle was found in Athlone, with the stolen goods in it. Three suspects were arrested but their four accomplices escaped. Traut said once they had been charged, the three suspects would appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court on a charge of business robbery. The firearms used in the robbery were not found.
