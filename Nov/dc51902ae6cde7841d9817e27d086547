Port Elizabeth - Police in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape are investigating two cases of house robbery after families were held up and robbed at knifepoint on Wednesday. Police spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu said during the early hours of Wednesday morning, in separate incidents, three televisions, three cellphones, a laptop and an iPad, as well as jewellery, were taken by robbers who entered the homes of residents and robbed them. Naidu said in the first incident, at about 01:00, a 43-year-old complainant was awakened by noises inside her house in Seaview. “The two unknown males threatened her with a knife and took the TVs, a laptop and two cellphones. It is alleged that entry was gained by forcing a sliding door open.” Naidu said in the second incident, at about 02:00, a 39-year-old complainant and his family were also held at knifepoint after three unknown males entered their home in Lorraine. Naidu said the complainant’s wife also woke up to noises and when she went to investigate, she was confronted by the three males who shoved her into a bedroom and tied up the family. “The suspects stole an iPad, cellphone and various items of jewellery. It is alleged that entry was gained by opening the back door through an open window." Police are urging secondhand dealers and pawn shops to immediately alert them as soon as anyone comes in to sell a TV or other items that may appear suspicious. Naidu said the community is advised to reject any goods that they may suspect to have been stolen and immediately report the matter to the police. “Never buy expensive goods at bargain prices from dealers with dubious credentials or from any unknown person. “ Naidu further warned the public that buying suspected stolen property was an offence and they may be arrested and charged if found in possession of such property.
