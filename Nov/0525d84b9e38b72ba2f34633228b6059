CAPE TOWN – In October, South Africa’s state-owned power utility Eskom warned of the risk of load-shedding following power constraints due to maintenance and unplanned outages at several of its electricity-generating units. The power system was “severely constrained”, said Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the nation’s power. However, this month it explained that there is a low probability of load shedding. “We have managed to conclude new coal contracts that will enable us to achieve an upwards turning on declining coal stock levels and bring about a marked improvement from December onwards, albeit slowly. Our short-term strategy to augment coal stocks at power stations that were below the minimum days is two-pronged, namely, coal procurement and diverting coal from well-stocked power stations,” Eskom group chief executive Phakamani Hadebe said. “We aim to improve coal stock levels at the impacted power stations from December and grow the total stock days from an average of 25 to 28 days by the end of the current financial year.” Nonetheless, it is good to be prepared for the worst.
