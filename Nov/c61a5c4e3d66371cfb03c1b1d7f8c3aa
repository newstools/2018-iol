CAPE TOWN – YouTube is launching its virtual reality app on the Oculus Go mobile VR headset today. This comes after Oculus announced the news at its Connect developer conference, along with other news about Oculus Go’s video offerings in September. "We’re giving people even more to watch. We’re excited to announce that YouTube VR is coming soon to Oculus Go, bringing more than 800K VR videos on a variety of subjects to the platform, from nature documentaries to the latest 360° concerts", the Oculus team said in a statement. The app will be available in the Oculus Store, joining similar apps for Samsung Gear VR, Sony PlayStation VR, Google Daydream VR, and desktop VR headsets. YouTube’s VR app supports 360-degree video and standard video in a VR theatre. Additionally, the company also introduced a casting feature that will let people easily stream their VR experiences to friends on mobile devices or TVs. It also includes social features, so users can watch videos with headset-wearing friends. WATCH:    BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
