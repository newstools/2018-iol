INTERNATIONAL – SoftBank Group has hired a Time Warner executive and former lawyer in the Clinton administration to spearhead its global communications strategy as the company transforms into one of the world’s largest technology investors. Gary Ginsberg will take up the New York-based role as senior vice-president and global head of communications on Thursday, SoftBank said. It is the latest high-profile hire by the Japanese firm, which is rapidly growing its global technology investment portfolio at a time when it faces challenges including criticism for its links to Saudi Arabia, the largest investor in its more than $93 billion (R1.3 trillion) Vision Fund. Previously, Ginsberg was an executive with News Corp, where he was widely described as a liaison between News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch and the Democratic Party. Earlier this month Softbank announced a partnership with Toyota to develop car services that will rely on self-driving. The self-driving cars services could possiblly include meal deliveries and shuttle buses. Reuters
