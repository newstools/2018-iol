Tshwane - The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) on Tuesday said it is investigating allegations of police brutality involving a Pretoria woman, and journalist Frans Sello Machate. The two investigations are unrelated. The woman's assault was allegedly suffered at the hands of two female police officers, and the video has been circulating on social media. "In video footage, the woman is pulled by her hair and shoved into a police vehicle," said Ipid national spokesperson Moses Dlamini. "This matter comes so soon after a complaint of assault was received from journalist Frans Machate. That matter is under investigation. Recommendations will flow from these investigations once they're concluded." Dlamini said it was important for the police to uphold the human rights of community members "and not use unnecessary force where it is unwarranted." He said police officers "should be protectors of the community and not its abusers." Last month, the Pretoria-based journalist, Machate, opened a case against Silverton police officers and the Tshwane Metro Police Department, after he was allegedly severely assaulted in front of his wife and young children at his house at around 2am. Machate says police officers from the two units broke down a palisade wall, security gates and doors, before entering his bedroom. CCTV cameras at Machate's Equestria house, east of Pretoria, were allegedly tampered with during the confrontation, and a hard drive with video footage is missing. African News Agency/ANA
