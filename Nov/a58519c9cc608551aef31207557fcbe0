JOHANNESBURG – The forensic report into the looting of Eskom and Transnet showed that the companies' erstwhile chief financial officer Anoj Singh did not use his salary for four years. The report urged the Hawks to investigate if Singh did not use other sources of income to service his personal accounts. "It is not clear how Singh was servicing his personal accounts because for a period of four years we could not see any debit orders or cash withdrawals for paying his personal accounts," read the report. 2013   2014  2015  2016  "The credits into Singh’s FNB account reflected above included what appears to be his monthly salaries from Transnet and Eskom. The credits further reflected large sums of money whose sources are unknown and suspicious," the investigators said. BUSINESS REPORT
