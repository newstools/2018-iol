Makapanstad - A Grade 1 pupil was stabbed to death inside a school toilet in Makapanstad, North West on Wednesday, the department of basic education said. "A Grade 1 pupil was stabbed multiple times, allegedly by a Grade 11 pupil from another school, Mankala Technical High School, who had been hiding in the primary schools toilet," said spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga. "It is alleged that the suspect apparently slept in the toilet overnight without anyone knowing he was there. The deceased was one of the first to go to the toilet in the morning and the Grade 11 pupil allegedly repeatedly stabbed him. He was rushed to the local clinic where he was sadly certified dead." He said the principal of the school managed to apprehend the alleged perpetrator and handed him over to the police. "It appears the suspect knew the deceased, and it is alleged that he was in a romantic relationship with the Grade 1 learner’s older sister who also attends Mankala Technical High School with the suspect. It is believed the couple may have had a fallout and the alleged perpetrator targeted the younger brother. However police will conduct a full investigation around the circumstance of this horrific murder,"  he said. The incident occurred at Dikeledi Makapan Primary School, in Makapanstad. North West Education member of the executive council (MEC) Sello Lehari, was expected to visit the school on Thursday.

Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga sent her deepest condolences to the family of the pupil. "Words cannot begin to comprehend the heartache caused by this tragic incident,"  she said.
