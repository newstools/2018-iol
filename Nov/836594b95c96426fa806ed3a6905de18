The partnership aims to drive financial inclusion by extending formal financial products and services to under-served members of co-operatives. Under this agreement, Nascu will introduce a secure, efficient and transparent electronic payment system to streamline and automate payments including payroll, loans, and disbursements to its savings and credit co-operative members. It will also issue 1.5 million Mastercard contactless debit payment cards to its members over the next five years, providing them with a convenient electronic payment tool to receive and make safe and simple payments for everyday commerce activities. The initiative is seen as a fundamental building block in developing a modernised and inclusive payments ecosystem in Zambia. With Mastercardâ€™s wide acceptance footprint, cardholders will be able to securely transact around the world. Mark Elliott, division president of Mastercard Southern Africa, said this collaboration with Nascu represented a major step forward in its strategy to create a cashless society and build an inclusive financial sector.
