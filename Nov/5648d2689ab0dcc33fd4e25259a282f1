Acquetico, Italy - Small European villages are not the kind of places that lend themselves to speeding. In fact we can vouch for that - having experienced countless car launches abroad, trying to keep cars intact on the ‘wrong’ side of the road, through ultra-narrow sections that were originally designed for horses, while dodging parked cars and impatient oncoming buses. And as a rule of thumb, the largeness of the car being launched often works in inverse proportion to the size of the streets on the route allocated to us. Yet clearly there are many European motorists that don’t see the sense in slowing down in such confined settings where pedestrians are clearly more vulnerable than they would be in more modern urban settings - and that’s particularly the case for a small Italian town called Acquetico. After a large chunk of the town’s 120 residents moaned about speeding motorists, its mayor decided to set up a camera, albeit only as a trial run. Needless to say, they are now pushing for it to become a permanent fixture after it caught over 55 000 speeding motorists in a period of just two weeks, according to the BBC. Almost half of all the passing cars exceeded the limit of 50km/h, dozens surpassing 100km/h and one even clocking 135km/h. "It's really madness, considering that we have inhabitants who regularly move within the village and cross the road," the town’s mayor Alessandro Alessandri said. Acquetico is located on a busy route in the north of Italy, close to the French border, but passers by will have to slow down soon, when the camera becomes a virtual fine dispensing machine.
