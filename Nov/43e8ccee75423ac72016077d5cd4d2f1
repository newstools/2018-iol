Rustenburg - Rap musician Jabulani Tsambo's body has left the Mmabatho Convention Centre in the North West for the cemetery where he will be buried on Saturday. The motswako pioneer, known as HHP, will be buried at the Hero's Acre section in the Mmabatho cemetery. He died on October 24 at his Johannesburg home, aged 38. He has been afforded a civic funeral. Earlier, North West premier Job Mokgoro told mourners that South Africa was in serious need of a moral regeneration. "We are a society that has all but lost its moral compass. Recently we laid to rest a teacher who was stabbed by a learner at a school premises. After stabbing him, the learner left the knife in his body. We are reading of rampant corruption in the media. We are learning of reports about a seven-year-[old child] raped in a restaurant restroom. We are in serious need of moral regeneration," he said. Through his song, Harambe, HHP had appreciated the freedom South Africans enjoyed today. Mokgoro had mourners on their feet when he voiced lyrics from the star rapper song Harambe. He said Jabba, as HHP was also known, had loved his hometown of Mahikeng and carried it in his heart wherever he went in the world. African News Agency (ANA)
