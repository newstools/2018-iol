Cape Town - Malusi Gigaba, who resigned as home affairs minister, deleted his Twitter account soon after the Presidency announced on Tuesday that he had submitted a letter of resignation to President Cyril Ramaphosa. However, memes of his exit ran rampant on social media. Gigaba said in his letter of resignation that he was stepping down for the sake of "our country", and also to relieve Ramaphosa from "undue" pressure. He also found himself in hot water and faced mounting pressure to explain how he had granted permission to the Oppenheimer's Fireblade Aviation to run a private terminal at OR Tambo International Airport. The Constitutional Court upheld the North Gauteng High Court's ruling that Gigaba had lied under oath after the tried to challenge the Public Protector's report on the Fireblade contract.      #MalusiGigaba pic.twitter.com/wI7xBr4QJ1  â€” Sawa Ngobeni (@directorsawa)
