CAPE TOWN – As South Africa prepares for Black Friday, which features massive savings for shoppers, Loot.co.za has announced that it will be offering some teaser deals in the run-up to the biggest shopping day on the calendar. Loot.co.za chief executive Gary Hadfield said in an interview with Business Report that the eCommerce platform would be offering thousands of deals with up to 65 percent off during its Black Friday 2018 sale. These deals will be across various categories including electronics, computers, cellular, kitchen & home toys, outdoor, books, gaming and will feature pop-up shops with new partners. “We will be launching some teaser deals daily from November 19 to 22 and the main Black Friday sale will run from November 23 to 26. They will be adding additional deals every day for the entire Black Friday weekend which includes Cyber Monday,” said Hadfield. In 2017 Loot saw televisions, notebooks, and cellular delivering the most revenue. Hadfield said he expected them to be key drivers this year although our other categories would also make a significant contribution to Black Friday sales. “Yes, we will be offering great deals in these core areas but our focus will be to increase the offer spread to cater for a broad spectrum of shoppers.” Last year Loot.co.za was in the top 10 most trafficked shopping sites in South Africa in November and December 2017 (both local and global players) which included classifieds, online retailers and price comparison, according to data from similarweb.com. “Black Friday revenues are important but it also acts as a catalyst for raising the profile of the loot brand, attracting new customers and creating momentum for the entire trading period,” said Hadfield.
