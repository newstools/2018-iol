CAPE TOWN – Twitter announced that it has updated its report process when users suspect that an account is fake or if they suspect that it might be coming from a bot. On the app, Users can now tap the “it’s suspicious or spam” option under the report menu and be able to specify why they think that, including an option to say “the account tweeting this is fake.” Twitter announced the change through its official safety account today, and it’s now available on both the web version and mobile version of the social platform. Twitter made the announcement via the social platform stating, "Activity that attempts to manipulate or disrupt Twitter’s service is not allowed. We remove this when we see it."      Back in July, the company had said that it had removed 70 million accounts in May and June of this year for violating its policies on malicious and spam reports. It was also evident in its most recent earnings report that Twitter had lost users from quarter to quarter because of the crackdown o fake accounts. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
