JOHANNESBURG - Riversands Boulevard will be closed off on Monday for two weeks to allow for the Telkom 947 Cycle Challenge. Organisers of cycle challenge said in a statement that Riversands Boulevard, in Fourways north of Johannesburg, will be temporarily closed for the 22nd edition of the race, including its Kiddies Ride and Mountain Bike sub-events at Riversands Commercial Park in November. The private road, built by Century Properties to service Riversands Commercial Park, serves as a bypass for traffic while the R511 extension between Steyn City and the N14 is under construction. "To mitigate the impact of the temporary road closure, the Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport agreed to open a temporary road on the R511. Traffic will be diverted to this road from Monday 5 November until Riversands Boulevard reopens on Wednesday 21 November," said the statement. Organisers said the Department and the JMPD have been fully briefed to manage the temporary road changes, including the ESSPC that oversees the overall safety of the event. "The local taxi association, RULDTA, will provide marshals to manage the taxi traffic, while JMPD accredited pointsmen have been appointed from the local community to manage traffic at crossover points," said the statement. The Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport will use emulsion to manage dust on the temporary road and will erect relevant road traffic signs to manage traffic on the road. “We call on all road users to bear with us during the temporary road closure. We have taken every precaution and instituted all possible alternatives to reduce the impact. Please obey the rules of the road and drive safely,” urged Alexia Poulos, Primedia Broadcasting Group Events Manager. African News Agency (ANA)
