Johannesburg - Generations: The Legacy star Rapulana Seiphemo on Tuesday admitted to contravening tax laws when he failed to submit his returns. The popular television actor  - popularly known as Tau Mogale - failed to submit his income tax returns from 2013 to 2017. The South African Revenue Services says Seiphemo owes more than R48 000 in unpaid tax. During proceedings on Tuesday at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court, State prosecutor Duduzile Robertse revealed that there were ongoing engagements with defence regarding an admission of guilt fine. The matter was postponed to 28 November. During his first appearance in court on October 18, Seiphemo's legal team said that they needed time to engage with Sars and make arrangements pertaining to his tax debacles. His team also apologised to the court, saying that they had tried in vain to make amends. At an earlier appearance on October 18, he was accompanied by his on-screen lover Zoe Mthiyane who plays the role of Zitha in the soapie. It was confirmed late last year after much speculation that the duo is also a couple off-screen. African News Agency/ANA and The Star
