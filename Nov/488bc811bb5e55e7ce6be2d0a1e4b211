The President of the DCCI Musa Makhunga highlighted the importance of government and business working with communities in South Africain to build a shared future. According to Makhunga, small, medium and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs) make up 90 percent of the businesses in sub-Saharan Africa and some of the challenges that they face include a lack of attention from the government.
