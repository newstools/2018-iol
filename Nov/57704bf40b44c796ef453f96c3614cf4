Mexico City - Mexico has started deporting 98 Central American migrants who were detained after trying to force their way into the United States through the Tijuana border, the National Institute of Migration said on Monday. Practically all of the deportees are Hondurans, Gerardo Garcia Benavente from the institute told the media company Televisa. An estimated 500 migrants tried to storm the border on Sunday. Police in Tijuana were overwhelmed, and US security forces reportedly used tear gas to turn the migrants back. Mexican Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete said those storming the border included "agitators" who would be deported. About 7,400 migrants are waiting in the border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali to enter the US, according to the Mexican authorities. USÂ President Donald Trump on Monday again vowed not to let the migrants in. "Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries. Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL!" he tweeted. Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who will be sworn in on Saturday, refused to meet representatives of the migrant caravan when it passed through Mexico City earlier this month. He has, however, promised to provide visas that will allow Central Americans to work in Mexico. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
