CAPE TOWN – Gemalto, a digital technology company based in Amsterdam, demonstrated its On-Demand Connectivity solution at AfricaCom today at the CTICC in Cape Town. Focused on digital security, software and sim card manufacturing, the company was founded in June 2006. Sherry Zameer, Senior Vice President of IoT Solutions, CIS, of the Middle East and Africa region believes that e-sim technology is the company's focus at the moment. Zameer said: “As the Internet of Things gathers momentum, more and more of the physical objects and devices we use will be connected to the network. The embedded SIM (eSIM) is becoming a reality that will enable millions of consumers to seamlessly connect their favourite devices anytime, anywhere.” “With 3.5 billion devices on the market by 2025, cellular connectivity will play a major role in bringing massive IoT to life both on the consumer and M2M markets, exponentially increasing the number of mobile connections.” Zameer mentions that the Gemalto offshore dedicated centres (ODC) unlock new avenues for mobile network operators will allow them to diversify their connectivity services into the world of IoT. For example, this means that users can link their expanding range of mobile devices—phones, tablets and now wearables—easily to the mobile operator and package of choice. In addition, eSIM technology means that activating a mobile package in a foreign country is seamless. "eSIMS will also impact device design. Because original equipment manufacturer can dispense with the physical SIM tray, device profiles can become slimmer and sleeker. Microsoft will be using eSIMs and ODC in the next wave of Windows 10 devices, thus pairing ODC with the globe’s most-used operating system", said Zameer in a statement. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
