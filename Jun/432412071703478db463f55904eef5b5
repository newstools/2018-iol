Mogwase - There is a con artist impersonating a Moses Kotane Local Municipality councillor selling tenders, the municipality said on Thursday. "[The] office of the speaker of the Moses Kotane Local Municipality has noted with concern the allegations based on the report that has been received, that there is a person impersonating councillor Lucky Moate. It is alleged that the impostor is selling municipal tenders for [an] amount of R20 000, demanding R5000 deposit from innocent victims," said spokesperson Beauty Makganye. She said Moate became aware of the scam when people he knew asked him why he did not tell them he was selling tenders. The conman is operating in the Mogwase and Lerome areas. It was not yet known how many people had been defrauded. "The municipality wishes to state that supply chain management processes are followed in line with the policy and councillors do not participate in supply chain management processes, including tendering," she said. "[The] speaker’s office strongly condemns the baseless allegations and further urge anyone with information to report fraud and related incidents to the police. Community members are advised not to be part of criminal activities." African News Agency (ANA)
