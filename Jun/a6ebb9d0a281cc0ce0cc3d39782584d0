New Delhi - An 8-year-old girl who was gang-raped and assaulted in India's Madhya Pradesh is recovering but remains traumatized, doctors said on Saturday, while protests were held across the state demanding quick justice. Two men in their 20s have been arrested in connection with the incident which took place on Tuesday, local police official Manoj Singh said. The child was waiting for her father near her school in Mandsaur town when she was allegedly picked up by the accused, who raped her and also tried to strangle her, police said. She was found unconscious hours later in a deserted area. Doctors at the MY Hospital in the city of Indore where she was admitted said they had to perform two surgeries, but the child was now conscious and recovering. There were protests in several towns in the region about the incident, NDTV news channel reported. "We will make sure the guilty are hanged; they don't deserve to live," Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said. The rape and killing of an 8-year-old girl in Jammu and Kashmir and several other cases of sexual assault of young girls earlier this year have sparked outrage in India. dpa
