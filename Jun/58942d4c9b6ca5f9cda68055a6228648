Secunda - Two men were killed and three other people were injured in a head-on collision between two cars on the R546 outside of Secunda in Mpumalanga in the early hours of Saturday morning, paramedics said. ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene to find that two vehicles had collided head-on. One vehicle was found in the middle of the road while the other was found on the side of the road, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. "Upon closer inspection, paramedics discovered the bodies of two men lying inside of one of the vehicles. Unfortunately, both men had already succumbed to their numerous injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead." Three other men were found on the scene. Paramedics assessed them and found that all three had sustained moderate injuries. The men were treated for their injuries and were thereafter transported to Evander Provincial Hospital for further treatment. The cause of the accident was not yet known, Meiring said.
