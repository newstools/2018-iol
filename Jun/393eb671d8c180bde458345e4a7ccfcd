Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva remains far ahead in a poll out Sunday of candidates in Brazil's October presidential election, even though he has been in prison for two months. Thirty percent of Brazilians would vote for Lula, who was Â president from 2003-2010, according to Datafolha pollsters. Lula, incarcerated at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba since April 7, is serving a 12-year sentence for taking an apartment as a bribe. The 72 year-old leftist politician insists on his innocence, saying the case is politically motivated. The previous Datafolha survey, published just after Lula was imprisoned, gave him 31% support. Datafolha said that 21% of those polled had no preference for president, while 17% would support far right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro and 10% ex-environment minister Marina Silva. Lula on Friday received full support from his Worker's Party (PT), which stated in a letter that they continued to support him as their presidential candidate "to the final consequences". Lula's time in office included a commodities-fuelled economic boom and major programs that lifted millions of Brazilians from extreme poverty. Datafolha interviewed 2,824 voters across the country, and the poll has a two percentage point margin of error. AFP
