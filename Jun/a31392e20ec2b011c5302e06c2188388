INTERNATIONAL - Samsung may launch the Galaxy Note 9 in August, and will offer a 512GB storage model in selected markets, Softpedia reported. The previous version of the device, the Galaxy Note 8, offered 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of onboard storage – and a microSD slot which could handle 256GB. The report did not state whether the Galaxy Note 9 will support a microSD card for expandable storage. Rumours suggest that users in South Korea and China are expected to receive the 512GB model first, with a global rollout not yet confirmed.The Note 9 will also reportedly receive upgraded cameras, according to Bloomberg. The new claim comes days after the five colour options of the next-generation Galaxy Note series phablet surfaced online. The new model is also rumoured to include a physical camera shutter button to make it easier to capture shots. The launch of the Galaxy Note 9 is so far said to be scheduled for August 9 at an "Unpacked" event in New York.
