Cape Town - The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) on Monday said it had dispatched one of its deep sea rescue craft to prevent a whale carcass spotted 200 metres offshore at Kommetjie from washing ashore. The NSRI said it had been alerted by eyewitnesses. Spokesman Craig Lambinon said the carcass was likely to wash ashore near the Kommetjie boat slipway. "The City of Cape Town (CoCT) Marine Animal Stranding Network were activated but as a precautionary measure NSRI Hout Bay launched the deep sea rescue craft Nadine Gordimer anticipating to reach the scene quickly to attach a towline to hold the whale carcass from washing ashore until a CoCT Marine Unit could get to the scene," said Lambinon.
