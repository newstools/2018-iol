Tel AvivÂ - The Israeli army said it targeted 25 Hamas positions in the Gaza Strip early Wednesday after Palestinian militants fired 45 rockets and projectiles from the coastal enclave at Israel. The pre-dawn exchange of fire comes at an especially tense time as around 130 Palestinians have been killed along the Gaza border in recent months as Palestinians stage mass demonstrations there. No Israelis or Palestinians were reported injured. Israeli jets bombed 25 targets including Hamas military compounds, the army said. Hamas, the militant group which rules the Gaza Strip, has not claimed responsibility for the projectile fire. Smaller militant groups, like the Islamic Jihad, operate semi-independently of Hamas and have previously fired rockets from Israel. The army blamed Hamas for the rocket fire adding that they are "responsible for everything that transpires in the Gaza Strip and will bear the consequences for deliberately targeting its terror at Israeli civilians." dpa
