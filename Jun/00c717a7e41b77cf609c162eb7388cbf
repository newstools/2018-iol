Johannesburg - Social media users were left bewildered after images of the Zimbabwean finance minister officiating at a bin opening ceremony began making the rounds online recently. Patrick Chinamasa, Zimbabwe'sÂ Finance and Economic Development Minister, was apparently opening a bin in the village of Rusape at an event that attracted fellow government officials. African exponent reports that, after the minister opened a multi-sports complex in the eastern Zimbabwe town, he went on to unveil three new bins to assist in improving waste management in the town. Chinamasa's move, however noble, was not well received online, with users slamming the minister the move as a mere "political stunt" so close to the 2018 elections. Among those commenting was #ThisFlag pastor Evan Mawarire, who reacted in shock and disbelief to the bin opening ceremony.   See below some reactions to the ceremony:                             IOL
