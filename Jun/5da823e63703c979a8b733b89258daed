London - Britain's Queen Elizabeth
granted royal assent to Prime Minister Theresa May's flagship
Brexit legislation on Tuesday, ending months of debate over the
legislation that will formally end the country's European Union
membership. The House of Commons speaker John Bercow said the EU
withdrawal bill, passed by both houses of parliament last week,
had been signed into law by the monarch, to cheers from
Conservative lawmakers. "I have to notify the House in accordance with the Royal
Assent Act 1967 that her Majesty has signified her royal assent
to the following acts ... European Union Withdrawal Act 2018,"
Commons Speaker John Bercow told lawmakers during a session of
the house. Reuters
