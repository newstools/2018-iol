Cape Town - The Democratic Alliance (DA) is demanding answers after a baby went missing at the Reefentse Clinic in Stinkwater, near Hammanskraal. It is believed that Khombo Mhlongo gave birth to a baby boy at the clinic on May 22. After her son was born, it was reported that the sister-in-charge took the newborn away, telling Mhlongo that she was going to bath him. However, when the concerned mother asked the sister of her baby's whereabouts later that evening, the sister replied that the baby had died. The opposition party calls on the nurse to be suspended until a probe into her involvement in the case of the missing baby is concluded. "Despite ongoing pressure, the Gauteng Department of Health has made no contact with the baby’s mother and has been slow to take action. This as a total disregard for the Mhlongo family and a failure by the clinic staff. We want the department to do its part to resolve the case of the missing baby," said DA Gauteng North Regional Chairperson, Abel Tau. Police are currently investigating the allegations. IOL
