Parliament - The attempts by the DA to get Parliament to institute an inquiry against Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane for her removal have been thwarted. This comes after the portfolio committee on justice on Wednesday decided that she must be given an opportunity first to respond to the DA’s submission before a decision is taken on whether to hold an inquiry into her fitness to hold office. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen had made a presentation to the committee where he listed reasons that warrant for the removal of Mkhwebane. One of the reasons is the scathing judgments against Mkhwebane in the recent times. But MPs said they needed to discuss the matter further.

However, committee chairman Mathole Motshekga said he agreed with other MPs who said the rules of natural justice must be followed in the matter. “There is a rule of natural justice that we must hear the other side and that other side is the Public Protector,” said Motshekga. He said they will give her Steenhuisen’s presentation to Mkhwebane to respond. But there was no deadline put for her to respond to Steenhuisen’s presentation. Politics Hub
