Istanbul - Turkish President Tayyip
Erdogan said in an interview late on Wednesday that his ruling
AK Party could seek to form a coalition if it fails to secure a
parliamentary majority in Sunday's elections. Polls indicate the elections may be closer than anticipated
when he called the snap elections in April, suggesting he may be
pushed to a second-round run-off for the presidency, and his AKP
could lose its majority in the 600-seat assembly. "If it is under 300 (seats), then there could be a search
for a coalition," Erdogan said in an interview with the Kral FM
radio station. He added that the probability of this was "very,
very low". The AK Party formed an alliance with the nationalist MHP
before the elections, which will herald a switch to a new
powerful executive presidency narrowly approved in a referendum
last year. Opposition parties also formed an alliance. MHP leader Devlet Bahceli said on Monday another election
could be held if his alliance with the AKP cannot form a
majority in parliament after Sunday's vote. Reuters
