Mahikeng - Job Mokgoro has been officially been sworn in as the premier of the North West. The 70-year-old Mokgoro was sworn in on Friday at the North West Provincial Legislature. The ceremony follows the ANC's confirmation that the Mokgoro had been picked for the top job by the party's national working committee. Mokgoro takes over from Supra Mahumapelo who resigned in May following widespread protests in the province. Mahumapelo, who remains the ANC chairperson in the North West, resigned as a member of the provincial legislature on Thursday which paved the way for Mokgoro to be sworn in. The swearing in ceremony was briefly disrupted by members of the opposition who questioned whether Mahumapelo had resigned. The EFF demanded to be furnished with the former premier's resignation letter. An EFF member was ejected from the chambers for disrupting proceedings.Â The red berets were wearing black armbands in honour of those residents that died during the protests that engulfed the province with calls for Mahumapelo to resign. Speaker Susan Dantjie dismissed requested for the resignation letter and said the letter would be sent to members at a later stage. Mokgoro is not new to the North West government. He has served as a director-general for the province and was currently serving as a principal of the National School of Governance. He will serve as the premier until next year's elections. Mokgoro admitted during his opening address that the task ahead of him was tough and complex. The North West government was recently placed under administration by the Cabinet. Residents have also complained about the lack of service deliver in the province. "We commit to restore stability in the province and the function of a robust oversight is critical," said Mokgoro.
