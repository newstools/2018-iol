Washington - The US Department of Homeland Security said late
Saturday it had reunited 522 children removed under its
"zero-tolerance" initiative with adults. A further 16 children will be reunited on Sunday, the department
said. A small number of children, who were separated for other
reasons, such as being unable to establish familial relationships,
will remain separated, it added. As of June 20, 2,053 separated children were being cared for by
Department of Health and Human Services in its facilities. President Donald Trump on Wednesday caved to pressure and signed an
executive order to keep migrant families together when they cross the
US-Mexico border, after details about the separations triggered
widespread outrage. Announced in April, the "zero-tolerance" policy meant children were
separated from their parents, who were immediately referred for
prosecution after they illegally crossed the border. The children were left in the custody of a sponsor or in shelters. DPA
