NEW YORK - Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein
pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges of rape and sexual
assault in the first cases involving the disgraced producer to
be tested in criminal court since scores of accusers emerged
last year, New York news media reported. Weinstein, 66, entered his plea in Manhattan Supreme Court
on Tuesday morning after a grand jury indicted him last week in
two cases, the New York Daily News reported. Weinstein turned himself in at a New York police station on
May 25, and was taken to court in handcuffs for his initial
arraignment. A judge ordered him released on a $1 million cash
bail on condition that he surrender his U.S. passport and agree
to wear a location-tracking device. He was ordered to remain in
New York state or Connecticut. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein, the co-founder of
the Miramax film studio and The Weinstein Co, of sexual
misconduct, including rape, with some allegations dating back
decades, all of which he has denied. Reuters
