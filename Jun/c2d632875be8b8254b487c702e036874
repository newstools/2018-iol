Indianopolis, Indiana - An Indiana State Police trooper who tweeted a photo of a vehicle he stopped for driving too slowly in the fast lane says he's overwhelmed by the widespread praise he's receiving online. Sergeant Stephen Wheeles stopped the driver on Saturday on Interstate 65 about 56 kilometres) south of Indianapolis after about 20 vehicles had slowed behind her. Wheeles says she was traveling at less than the 112km/h speed limit. Indiana law requires drivers to move to the slow lane to allow faster traffic to pass.  The post has been retweeted by IndyCar driver Graham Rahal, who said, "This guy is my hero," and Fox NFL announcer and Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman. Others suggested he win a Nobel Prize or asked him to relocate to their states. AP
