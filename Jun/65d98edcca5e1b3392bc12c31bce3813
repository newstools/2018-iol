Mumbai, India - A small chartered plane crashed Thursday in a busy area of Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital, killing at least six people including two on the ground, police said.

The Press Trust of India news agency said the fatalities included two pilots and two flight engineers on the aircraft. Police officer Ashok Shirsad said two people on the ground were also killed.

Television images showed parts of the plane burning on the ground. Eight fire trucks rushed to the crash site. Fire official R. Pawar said the bodies recovered from the wreckage were badly burned.
