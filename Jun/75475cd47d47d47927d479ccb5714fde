Johannesburg - The Indlulamithi South African Scenarios towards 2030 - which considers the economy; work and society; environmental justice; reconciliation and redress; and crime and safety - will assist the country to understand the possible paths to take to ensure cohesion, prosperity and equality, President Cyril Ramaphosa said. “Any nation that seeks progress and development must be able to first envision it. The Indlulamithi Scenarios help the country understand the possible paths it can take and what needs to be done now to ensure that it takes the path of greatest cohesion, prosperity and equality,” Ramaphosa earlier told the team of the Indlulamithi South African Scenarios. Ramaphosa will deliver the keynote address at the launch of the Indlulamithi South African Scenarios on Thursday. The Presidency said the South African Scenarios was an independent project initiated by respected academic Dr Somadoda Fikeni, multinational Anglo American and the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (MISTRA). His office said it is aimed at framing a national conversation, beyond the current national trajectory, to answer the question “what would a socially cohesive South Africa look like, and to what degree is it attainable by 2030”.
