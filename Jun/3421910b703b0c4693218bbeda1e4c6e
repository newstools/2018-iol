Johannesburg - The two hour load shedding implemented by Eskom has ended, the power utility confirmed on Thursday evening. Eskom earlier announced that due to "severe power constraints", it would implement stage one of load shedding on Thursday night between 5.50pm and 8pm. This comes as trade unions at Eskom are currently engaged in a shut down of operations and earlier staged a picket at the utility's power stations and at headquarters in Megawatt Park over a wage dispute. Workers are demanding salary increments of up to 15% while Eskom is offering none. The power utility in a statement confirmed that it had stopped load shedding at 7:59pm.

Eskom apologised for the inconvenience to affected customers. IOL
