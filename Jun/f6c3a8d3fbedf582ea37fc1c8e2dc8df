 Welcome to our village wee one. Feeling very lucky to have a healthy baby girl that arrived at 4.45pm weighing 3.31kg (7.3lb) Thank you so much for your best wishes and your kindness. We're all doing really well thanks to the wonderful team at Auckland City Hospital. A post shared by  Jacinda Ardern (@jacindaardern) on Jun 20, 2018 at 11:14pm PDT
