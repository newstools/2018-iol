Harare, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe's main opposition party says it will create a $100 billion economy within a decade and improve ties with Israel if it wins the July 30 elections. The MDC-T, which has re-energized under 40-year-old Nelson Chamisa, launched its election manifesto Thursday. The state broadcaster, which is closely aligned with the ruling party, provided rare live coverage. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power in November when longtime leader Robert Mugabe stepped down under pressure, has promised free and fair elections in a country with a history of disputed polls. Both Mnangagwa and the opposition pledge to improve the once-prosperous economy and attract foreign investors put off by years of international sanctions. Opening an embassy in Israel would mark a major foreign policy shift for Zimbabwe, which enjoys close relations with the Palestinians. AP
