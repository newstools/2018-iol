KHARTOUM - Sudan said on Wednesday it had
cut all defence ties with North Korea, in a rare admission that
it used to have such ties in the first place. The announcement came as Washington is locked in a standoff
over Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programmes, and as
Sudan, which is still on the U.S. list of state sponsors of
terrorism, reels from an economic crisis. "Sudan's government would like to affirm that its defence
production sector has cancelled all contracts ... with North
Korea, and ended all relations, direct or through a third
party," the foreign ministry said in a statement. It said this came as part of its commitment to the
international Non-Proliferation Treaty and sanctions against
Pyongyang. It did not say when ties had been severed, or provide
details of what they had been. The United States lifted 20 years of sanctions on Sudan in
October, in a move that looked set to help Sudan's ailing
economy, but the country has since plunged into a fiscal crisis,
with the Sudanese pound's value plummeting and no significant
increase in foreign investment. Washington said then that Sudan had made progress fighting
terrorism, and that it had secured Khartoumâ€™s commitment not to
pursue arms deals with North Korea. But Sudan remains on the U.S. list of state sponsors of
terrorism - alongside Syria and Iran - which means a ban on
weapons sales and restrictions on U.S. aid. Sudan's economic problems led to widespread protests earlier
this year. Reuters
