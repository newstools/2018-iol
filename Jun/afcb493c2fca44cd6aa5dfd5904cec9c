Cape Town - The DA has reiterated its call for specialised policing units to fight crime in rural areas after Dr Leslie Van Niekerk was shot in the stomach, and her husband Herkie and farm worker Abram Kethisha were assaulted on their farm Varkenskuil near Modimolle. Details of the attack, which took place on Friday morning, are still unknown. "I will write to the MEC for Community Safety, Makoma Makhurupetje, to request a meeting to discuss the safety of our rural communities as well as the lack of resources within the South African Police Service (SAPS) to keep our people safe," said Jacques Smalle, the DA's provincial leader in Limpopo. Smalle called on the ANC government to display "the political will to effectively deal with these attacks and the senseless violence". "Limpopo rural communities – farmers as well as farm workers - are increasingly at risk as the SAPS have limited personnel and resources to prevent violent crime in secluded and vast rural areas," said Smalle.
