And it seems that gifts and quality time spent with their offspring are the order of the day tomorrow as children across South Africa celebrate their fathers. Ahead of Father’s Day, South Coast businessman, husband to four wives and father to 10 children Musa Mseleku has encouraged fathers who have not had the best relationships with their children to focus on improving these relationships. “I always say I don’t want us to be absent as fathers and husbands, we must not shift the responsibility of being a father to money. Having money doesn’t mean fatherhood - it’s having the time for your children and being a parent that’s important,” he said. The Mselekus are no strangers to KwaZulu-Natal viewers, having had two seasons of their reality show uThando ne- Sthembu (Love and Polygamy) aired on DStv’s Mzansi Magic. Mseleku says lessons such as ubuntu and understanding the world can’t be bought with money. “I urge fathers to return home and be present. Go home and spend time with your children.” He will be at home tomorrow although he is not sure of what is planned. “I heard that the little ones are going to make me cards, so I look forward to that. “It makes me happy to be in this position as a father, it warms my heart.” He said his children were the reason he “wakes up every morning” and was motivated to work harder to be able to provide them with what they needed.
