 London - A robber cut off the hand of a disabled woman to steal her ring, a court  heard yesterday. Jurors were told that Stephen Brisbane then took Sandra McGowan’s hand away with him after the horrific attack, which took place in her own home. Brisbane, 33, is accused of entering the 62-year-old’s Dundee house ‘uninvited’ on February 14. He is said to have stolen a number of items, including a mobile phone and door fob. He then assaulted Miss McGowan, causing her to fall from her wheelchair, the High Court in Glasgow heard. Prosecutors claim he then severed her right hand with a knife, causing Miss McGowan to fall unconscious. It is further claimed Brisbane took away her right hand, stealing her ring. He also allegedly did not get medical help. No plea was entered during the hearing. Judge Lord Mulholland continued the case until next month.  Daily Mail
