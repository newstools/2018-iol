Dear Editor, Your article "Peta's shocking video could ravage local mohair industry" (11 June) includes several misleading statements about PETA's recent mohair exposé. As much as Mohair SA would like to portray the kinds of abuse that take place in its industry as the acts of a few "bad apples", they aren't. When animals are seen as nothing more than commodities to be turned into sweaters or blankets, rough handling and abuse will follow. Don't forget that shearers are paid by volume, not by the hour, so they're driven to work quickly and carelessly. It's also absurd to suggest that 800,000 goats will die as responsible companies cut ties with this cruel industry. Goats bred for mohair aren't retired to sanctuaries when they've outlived their usefulness to farmers – they're slaughtered. As demand for mohair decreases, fewer goats will be bred, and far fewer will end up on the slaughter line, which is often in the farm's backyard. Consumers can help foster this transition by shunning mohair and other animal-derived materials and embracing the many sustainable vegan options that are now available. Sincerely, Jason Baker Vice President of International Campaigns People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) * The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
