Durban - Next week consumers’ budgets will be squeezed even tighter as they’re hit with yet another massive fuel price increase seeing petrol smash the R15 a liter barrier for the first time. According to the AA, motorists should brace themselves for an increase of 85 cents per litre of petrol and 87 cents per litre for diesel. “People often underestimate the impact that their driving habits have on fuel consumption, but minor tweaks can help protect your pocket at the pump,” says Susan Steward, Marketing Manager of Budget Insurance. According to the Department of Energy in the US, smart driving could increase your fuel economy by as much as 40%, meaning that on a tank that normally gets you 650km, you could get more than 900 km. This translates to almost a tankful of savings for every two times you fill up, she says. "If you fill up 48 times a year at R700 per tank, a 40% reduction in fuel consumption could save you more than R13 000 a year. So, just by changing the way you drive and keeping your car in tip-top shape, you could have an extra R1 000 at your disposal each month. Who can say no to that?” said Steward.
