JOHANNESBURG - Hundreds of security guards on Tuesday marched to the offices of Gauteng member of the executive council (MEC) dfor Security and Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane in Johannesburg to hand over a memorandum of demands. The protest comes after the recent number of cash-in-transit heists. One of the workers June -- who did not want to reveal his last name -- said they were not asking for too much and that they just wanted better working conditions; to be protected by the police; and also want their wages to be raised because their lives were in danger. “I have a wife and kids to look after, we want to work without fear and we want the police to accompany us everywhere we go,” he said. “We also want R20,000 as a basic minimum wage”.
