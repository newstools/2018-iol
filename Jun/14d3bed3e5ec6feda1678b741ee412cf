Kabul - Dozens of Taliban militants entered the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Saturday as a ceasefire between the government and militants held for a second day. Afghan media outlets such as television stations ToloNews and Ariana News showed Interior Minister Wais Ahmad Barmak allegedly meeting Taliban militants in the eastern Kabul neighbourhood of Company. The authenticity of the images could not immediately be confirmed. However, a Defence Ministry spokesman, Mohmmad Radmanish, told dpa that "Taliban are allowed in and have visited cities, including the capital, Kabul, during the truce to celebrate Eid days with their families and friends." Kabul police and sources in the Afghan spy agency NDS confirmed that a number of Taliban militants entered Kabul on Saturday, but that they were disarmed beforehand. A dpa reporter met several Taliban militants in a western neighbourhood of Kabul. One said that they were not against anyone today and were there for peace. Another group was surrounded by happy residents chanting "God is great" and posing for selfies with them. Since the beginning of the year, Taliban and Islamic State militants have staged 13 attacks in Kabul city, killing more than 300 people and wounding more than 500 others. Photos and videos from across the country showed happy crowds celebrating their second day of their mini-peace. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a unilateral eight-day ceasefire with the Taliban on Tuesday amid an increasingly bloody war. The Taliban subsequently offered a three-day ceasefire over the Eid holidays. Ghani made a comprehensive peace offer in February. However, the militants have only increased their attacks. dpa
