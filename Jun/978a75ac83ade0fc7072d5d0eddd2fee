Johannesburg - There are only 12 working public ambulances in the whole of Swaziland/Eswatini to serve 1.1 million people, this as the government fails to maintain them and has not bought any new ambulances since 2013. Director of the Emergency Preparedness Response Department under the Ministry of Health, Masitsela Mhlanga, told media there were 20 broken-down ambulances in garages that were not being fixed, Swazimedia.blogspot reported. In April this year, King Mswati, one of the world's few absolute monarchs, announced that his country had changed its name to eSwatini to mark 50 years since independence from British rule.
