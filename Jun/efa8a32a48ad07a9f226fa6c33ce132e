Mannheim - Mannheim is seeking a new "night mayor" to
promote the south-western German university city's nightlife and
party scene. The idea is modelled on other cities like Amsterdam and London which
have similar positions. The job, on a fee-based contract, is being advertised until June 30
and aims to promote the city's nightlife and deal with the concerns
of residents. "It doesn't matter if it's about noise or litter on the streets, the
'night mayor' should have conversations with residents and pub and
club owners to develop common solutions," Matthias Rauch, who is
responsible for the city's cultural development, recently said. "It is therefore also important that the licensees of the bars, pubs
and clubs connect with each other," Rauch said in comments published
on Sunday. The right person for the job should know the city's party scene but
also have a talent for mediation and conflict resolution. The core working hours - as suggested by the job title - will often
be in the wee hours of the morning. The city hopes to have the "night mayor" position filled by August 1. DPA
