JOHANNESBURG- The Black Business Council (BBC) said on Monday the appointment of Madoda Mxakwe as group CEO at the South African Broadcasting Corporation would bring much-needed stability after a long leadership vacuum at the public broadcaster. Mxakwe's appointment would also allow the SABC to speed up the process of digital migration, BBC CEO Kganki Matabane said. Mxakwe brings a wealth of global, regional and local experience to the SABC having served in several roles at Nestle across Africa. He has a masters degree in the global political economy from the UK’s Sussex University, executive leadership development certificates from the London Business School as well as a post graduate diploma in business administration from the Gordon Institute of Business Science. “We wish him well in his long journey of ensuring that the SABC has proper corporate governance structures and processes in place and can be returned to financial sustainability and not depend on state bailouts” Matabane said. - African News Agency
