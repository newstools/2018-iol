CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has hit out at the Democratic Alliance (DA) over what it said was its "political chest-thumbing (sic)" over the province's recent rainfall which has helped alleviate the prolonged drought situation. In a statement on Friday morning, the ANC commended "the people of Western Cape for their great resilience under a heavy yoke of severe water restriction over the last year. "The ANC therefore rejoices with the people for much needed rainfall over the last few weeks which have significantly increased the province's water dams," ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs said.. "As the ANC, we, however, reject the DA's political-chest thumbing (sic) which is suddenly parading their failed demand water management exercise, a pathetic response to a crisis that needed nothing short of real and substantive new sources of water supply."

Day Zero - the day when the city's taps was set to run dry - was averted earlier this year.
