CAPE TOWN - Judgment has been reserved in High Court in Cape Town on Tuesday, where Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille is trying to hold on to her mayoral chain by taking on the political party which put her in office. De Lille's lawyers argued her automatic termination as a Democratic Alliance (DA) member, which would result in her losing her mayoral post, was unfair and the clause used by the party to give effect to her termination was unlawful and should be set aside. The DA argued that it has a right to make its own rules, insisting that De Lille publicly stating in a radio interview in April that she would resign only once her name is cleared meant that she was disloyal to the party. The DA abandoned disciplinary proceedings against her in connection with alleged misconduct after they invoked the clause leading to her membership termination.
