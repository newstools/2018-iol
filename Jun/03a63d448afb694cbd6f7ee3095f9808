Johannesburg - A Joburg Metro police officer is facing three counts of culpable homicide over an accident that resulted in the death of three people, including a child. The incident occurred near the Golden Highway and Elephant Street in Vlakfontein Extension 1 on Sunday evening. According to the MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun, the off-duty officer ploughed into the rear end of another vehicle which in turn, collided with a taxi, killing three people in the process. “The JMPD officer in question was suspected to be under the influence of alcohol and was taken for a breathalyser test at the JMPD Wemmer Pan Complex. The officer was then arrested and charged with three counts of culpable homicide, the metro police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar confirmed. The MMC condemned the actions of the officer, saying the city would not tolerate any of its officers being on the wrong side of the law. “We will not tolerate our JMPD officers to be on the wrong side of the law or allow any unethical conduct. I want to echo JMPD Chief of Police, Mr. David Tembe’s message - that when one officer does wrong, that officer taints the reputation of the entire JMPD,” said Sun. He added that the Department of Public Safety would cooperate with the police’s investigation and will ensure that justice takes its course. “Our deepest condolences go out to the families who have lost their loved ones in such a tragic manner,” Sun said.
