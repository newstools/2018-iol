CAPE TOWN - American magazine, Rolling Stone reportedly published a revealing story about Hollywood actor, Johnny Depp which details his money troubles and spiraling drinking. The writer of the expose, Stephen Rodrick reportedly spent 72 hours with Depp at his London mansion, reports BuzzFeed. According to Rolling Stone, almost all of Depp’s entire R8.7 billion fortune is gone. There are also allegations that the actor is suing his former business partner, Joel Mandel and his brother, Robert for "negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud."

Depp’s reported crazy expenses: - R1.4 billion on more than a dozen residences. - R40.5 million to shoot the ashes of his friend Hunter S.Thompson into the air from a cannon. - R94 700 to buy his daughter a couch from the set of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. - Up to R2.7 million each month on private air travel and he also bought 200 pieces of art which include work by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. - Depp reportedly responded to TMG’s claim and said it in fact costed him R67 million instead of R40 million. In other Depp news, the actor was last month sued by two of his former bodyguards. The 54-year-old actor faced legal action from security professionals Eugene Arreola and Miguel Sanchez, who sued for a range of reasons, including unpaid wages and wrongful termination. The duo were employees of the security firm Premiere Group International, but according to the lawsuit, Depp hired them both individually after he'd decided to cut his ties with the company in 2016. Arreola and Sanchez claimed they were told they would be considered "employees" by Depp, meaning they were to receive all of the usual benefits. The duo said that between 2016 and 2018, "things began to spiral toward chaos", adding that they "found themselves in situations that required more than what a bodyguard would be expected to do". More specifically, Arreola and Sanchez alleged that they were "asked repeatedly to drive vehicles that contained illegal substances, open containers and minors". In the lawsuit, they also alleged that they were "forced to protect [Depp] from himself and his vices while in public, becoming caretakers for him". The bodyguards explained that the "unsafe conditions and situations" in which they were forced to work led to them developing "stress-related injuries".
