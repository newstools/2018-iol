Pretoria - Peak hour traffic is flowing steadily in Mamelodi, following earlier protest action by residents for service delivery. Police dispersed protesters who blocked all the entrances to Mamelodi. The taxi drivers said the ongoing protests were affecting their daily operations. They added that it was even more difficult with school closures and not having enough people to make a profit. The taxi drivers mobilised and searched for the protesters. A violent fight broke out between protesters and taxi drivers. The drivers carrying sjambok and batons whipped protests in a desperate attempt to disperse them. They retaliated by hurling stones. Peak hour traffic is also moving steadily around the Denneboom area and Solomon Mahlangu Road. Meanwhile Metro police had to disperse protesters who barricaded the the municipal offices at Mamelodi West. Protesters gathered from about 10am outside the premises. Chairperson of Tshwane Concerned Residents, Oupa Mtshweni said Mayor Solly Msimanga was not taking them seriously, and was concerned with overseas trips rather than fixing his own home. “We marched to Tshwane House in April with our list of demands and gave him adequate time to respond, but like always he ignored us,” he said.
