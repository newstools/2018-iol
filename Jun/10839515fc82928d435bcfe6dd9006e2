Parliament - The Portfolio Committee on Police has called for vetting and lifestyle audits on South African Police Service (SAPS) members as a way to curb corruption. This comes after a police constable was arrested on Wednesday for theft and corruption relating to the theft of 18 firearms at a Bellville police station. The 34-year-old constable from the Bellville South Community Service Centre (CSC) was arrested by the Hawks’ National Bureau for Illegal Firearms Control and Priority violent crime. Welcoming the arrest was committee chairperson Francois Beukman, who called on SAPS and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to ensure a successful prosecution. “It is disappointing that an officer of the law is alleged to have conspired in breaking the law and possibly aiding the perpetration of crime. The SAPS must work with the NPA to ensure successful prosecution,” Beukman said.

Beukman also stressed the need to implement vetting and lifestyle audits to "fight against any form of corruption". "There is urgent need to implement lifestyle audits on SAPS members to fight against any form of corruption. Vetting and life style audits can be an effective way of removing rogue officers within the system and ensure the return of the credibility of the organization. IOL
