Rustenburg - Higher Education and Training Deputy Minister Buti Manamela on Thursday, encouraged young people to consider Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges as areas of study. "I know that all of you here want to go to Wits University, [University of Johannesburg] UJ, [University of Cape Town] UCT and the North West University, because our parents always encourage us to go to universities. But we must also go to TVET colleges such as Orbit College because they also give opportunities," he said. He was speaking to high school learners and post matric youth from Tlapa village near Rustenburg during a career expo. The expo focused on bringing career guidance information to rural areas. Opportunities presented included apprenticeship, bursaries and artisan-ships. Manamela said the expo was an opportunity for young unemployed youth and high school learners to get information to make the right future choices. He said the country was in need of skills that would contribute to the economy, adding that carpenters, welders, electricians and builders play a huge role in the country. "These careers will also promote self employment of individuals as jobs are scares," he said. "We can only change our situations if we have civil engineers coming from our villages. They are able to grade roads their people use in those villages. Let us be skilled where we are able to contribute to the economy..." He said specific areas such as artisans should also be prioritised. "As the department we are aiming to get 30 000 artisans in a year and we have reached that limit. But we continue encouraging young people to enter that field." African News Agency (ANA)
