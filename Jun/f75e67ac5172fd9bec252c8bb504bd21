RUSTENBURG - Bakgatla Ba Kgafela Traditional Council (BBKTC) chairperson Kobedi Pilane on Wednesday lashed out at the legal team representing the council at at the Maluleke Commission. "I am troubled that I have documents that my legal team did not alert me about. All this time I thought that I was with them but it is clear we were never together. It is clear that there are divisions," he said. "I should have been notified. They must indicate whether they are on the left, right or in the middle. My legal team is supposed to advise me on such things." He was presented with five letters directed to Bakgatla leadership which contained various information. According to him he was supposed to have been notified of the letters by his legal team. "I am aware of these letters because I have received four of them and Kgosi [Nyalala Pilane] is in possession of them. The other letter I am not aware of," he said.
