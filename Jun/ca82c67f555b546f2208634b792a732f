Mahikeng - New North West premier Professor Job Mokgoro on Friday said he had a specific mandate - to restore hope and trust in the province. Mokgoro, who was elected unopposed and sworn in as premier on Friday, said he would start as early as next week to try to restore trust between the provincial government and people of North West. "The party is over...I am bringing a sound administration that I will hand over in 2019 and ensure a landslide victory for the ANC." Mokgoro inherited a province riddled with service delivery protests which culminated in the resignation of Supra Mahumapelo as premier last month after coming under pressure from the ruling African National Congress. The Kgerlengrivier municipality mayor's house was torched in Reagile near Koster in May when rioting residents demanded access to basic municipal services. In April, public servants in the department of health downed tools and demanded improved working conditions and that the provincial health department head Thabo Lekalakala should be dismissed. Lekalakala was suspended. Opposition parties have appealed to Mokgoro to fire some members of the provincial cabinet who served in former premier Supra Mahumapelo tenure. Mahumapelo resigned as a member of the provincial legislature to make way for Mokgoro. African News Agency (ANA)
