Motorists will be encouraged to donate a R10 packet of sanitary pads towards the Trek’s campaign to keep 500000 girls at school this year. All motorists will receive special Trek4Mandela licence holders free - and the first 100 customers will each receive a free Trek4Mandela T-shirt. Everest hero Sibusiso Vilane will be there for motorists to meet, as well as many members of this year’s Trek4Mandela centenary edition who will be leaving for Kilimanjaro on July 12 in their bid to summit the iconic mountain on July 18, what would have been Madiba’s 100th birthday. There will be outdoor broadcasts from the forecourt by both the SABC and Kaya FM and a lucky draw for one motorist to join Trek4Mandela 2019’s training camp weekend in the Drakensberg next year and experience the preparation for themselves under Vilane’s expert tutelage. Trek4Mandela is the publicity arm for Caring4Girls, a grassroots initiative designed to break the taboo around menstruation and raise funds to ensure that no girl will miss a single day of school because she is unable to deal with her period. Studies estimate that girls in deprived areas can lose up to a fifth of their high school career because of a lack of access to sanitary pads - making their bid to successfully finish school a personal summit many are never able to conquer. Trek4Mandela/ Caring4Girls founder Richard Mabaso said: “We continue to remind people that Trek4Mandela is an event to encourage them to be like Madiba to think of others. “Each one of us can do our little bit to help create a better, more caring world, by ensuring that even one girl has the chance to finish her school career without missing a day because of the shame associated with not being able to properly manage her monthly period.” * If you would like to know more about Trek4Mandela or donate towards Caring4Girls, please contact Nkateko Mabale on email: nkateko@imbumbafoundation.org or call +27662142520.
