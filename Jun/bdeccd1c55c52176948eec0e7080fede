JOHANNESBURG - Rights group Amnesty International says the failure by the Nigerian government to hold murderers to account is encouraging them and fueling rising insecurity across the country. Amnesty said independently verified estimated figures showed at least 1,813 people have been murdered in 17 states in Nigeria this year, double the 894 people killed in 2017. The death tolls reflect killings as a result of farmers-herders conflicts, communal clashes, Boko Haram attacks and banditry. “We are gravely concerned about the rising spate of killings across the country, especially the communal clashes between farmers and herders and attacks by bandits across at least 17 states,” Amnesty International Nigeria director Osai Ojigho said. “The authorities have a responsibility to protect lives and properties, but they are clearly not doing enough going by what is happening." “The latest incidence in Plateau State, where armed gunmen attacked 11 villages on June 23 for at least seven hours and killed at least 200 villagers without intervention from security forces should be investigated," said Ojigho. Amnesty said it showed unacceptable security lapses that the violence in Plateau started after an attack, which was followed by reprisal attacks from Thursday to Saturday last week. “Despite the deployment of security forces, including the military in over 30 states, the escalation of these attacks shows that whatever is being done by authorities is not working," it said.
