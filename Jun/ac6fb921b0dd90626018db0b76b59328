JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe’s main opposition party said on Thursday it aims to create a $100 billion economy within a decade and re-establish ties with Israel — a major foreign policy shift — if it wins July 30 elections, AP reported. The MDC-T, which has been re-energised under 40-year-old leader Nelson Chamisa, launched its election manifesto with rare live coverage from the state broadcaster, which is closely aligned with the ruling party. - African News Agency (ANA)
