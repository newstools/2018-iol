Harare - Hundreds of Zimbabwean opposition supporters marched
through the streets of Harare on Tuesday demanding electoral reforms
and free and fair polls next month. The opposition supporters were addressed by main opposition Movement
for Democratic Change presidential candidate Nelson Chamisa, 40,
before heading to the Zimbabwe Election Commission (ZEC) to hand over
a petition calling for transparency. "If ZEC want to hold a credible, free and fair election, we demand
that all parties involved should know who is printing the ballot
paper to avoid rigging," Chamisa said. "If the voters' roll has not been audited by credible and an
independent external auditor, there cannot be an election," he added. Zimbabwe goes to the polls on July 30 with 75-year-old President
Emmerson Mnangagwa, a veteran of the 1970s liberation war and
previously a close ally of ex-President Robert Mugabe, the incumbent. Mugabe was forced to resign during a military coup in November, after
ruling the country for over three decades, during which there were
numerous allegations of vote-rigging and intimidation. Mnangagwa has promised these elections will be free and fair and has
invited EU observers to monitor the vote. But the opposition ZECÂ petition complained that state media has been
biased towards the ruling party. It is also demanding no ex-military
officials be allowed to work for the election body. "We do not want soldiers to work for ZEC because they will not
transfer power if the ruling party loses," said one protester
35-year-old Tinei Tinarwo. DPA
