Groblersdal - Police in Dennilton near Groblersdal have arrested a 29-year-old nephew of a man brutally killed at Matlala Lehwelere village. This followed an incident on Tuesday when police received a tip-off from relatives of the murdered man that they had discovered a burnt body dumped inside a pit toilet, Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said. When police arrived at the scene they found a badly burnt body "stashed in a wheelbarrow" in an old pit toilet. Preliminary police investigations recovered "pieces of vehicle tyres which are believed to be some of the objects used to burn the deceased". "The deceased was positively identified by his family as Kaizer Makola, aged 42 years, from this village. Following this gruesome discovery a manhunt for the suspect was launched and subsequently a 29-year-old nephew of the deceased was arrested last night [Friday] at the same village, and he is being positively linked to this incident. The motive behind this cold-blood[ed] murder is still unknown at this stage, but domestic violence may not be ruled out." The suspect would appear in the Moutse Magistrate's Court on Monday on a charge of murder. The police investigations were still continuing, Ngoepe said. African News Agency/ANA
