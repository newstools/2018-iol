The index has dropped for 12 quarters in a row. StatsSA also announced that mining production had decreased by 4.4percent in April compared with the same month last year. This weak economic data, as well as the re-introduction of load shedding by Eskom had a negative effect on bond rates. The R186 had increased by 5 points, or 5.5percent, to 9.02percent over the week.
