London - Police and
activists in Britain have issued warnings over domestic violence
ahead of England's first World Cup football match on Monday,
with evidence showing abuse levels spike when the national team
plays. A number of forces across the country have joined the Give
Domestic Abuse the Red Card campaign, which provides support for
potential victims. "For those who refuse to address their behaviour our message
is clear," said Anne-Marie Salwey, specialist crime
superintendent with the police force of Cleveland in northeast
England, in a statement. "We will not tolerate domestic abuse and will take action
against anyone who uses physical or mental abuse to control,
coerce or harm a member of their family. Football can never be
the reason for domestic abuse and will be shown the red card." Several police forces in Britain said they would deploy
extra forces to safeguard potential victims of abuse as England
prepared to take on Tunisia. The most detailed research into the links between the World
Cup and domestic abuse found that violent incidents in
Lancashire in northeast England increased by 38 percent when the
national team lost and by 26 percent when they won. Lancaster University criminologist Dr Stuart Kirby, a former
police officer, monitored police reports of domestic violence
during the last three World Cups in 2002, 2006 and 2010. "Domestic abuse does not happen in a cultural vacuum," said
Katie Ghose, chief executive of domestic violence charity
Women's Aid, in a statement to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. "The sexist attitudes, chants and behaviour at football
matches encourage an environment in which women are belittled
and demeaned," she said. "Together, we can send out the powerful message that
domestic abuse is always unacceptable and that there is no place
for violence in football whether on or off the pitch." Thomson Reuters Foundation
