BONN â€” Russia's team has been banned from the upcoming Pyeongchang Paralympics because of its doping past. The International Paralympic Committee says about 35 Russians will be allowed to compete in five sports as neutral athletes at the games, which run from March 8-18. That mirrors the situation for next month's Olympics. The Russian team has been barred, but 169 Russians have been invited to compete. It will be the second Paralympics without a Russian team. The country was also excluded from the Rio de Janeiro Paralympics in 2016.
