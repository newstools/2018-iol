CAPE TOWN - Uber said on Tuesday its British drivers will have to take a six-hour break after they have accepted and made trips with passengers totalling to 10 hours as the taxi app responds to criticism over excessive working hours. Uber said last month nearly a third of its 50,000 drivers in Britain are logged into the app for more than 40 hours a week, whilst just under 8% are online for more than 60 hours. It has been attacked by trade unions and lawmakers who say that some of its drivers are working too long, one of many criticisms it has faced about its business model as it battles to keep operating in London after being stripped of its licence.

He said the app planned to make other changes to the way it operates in the next few months.
