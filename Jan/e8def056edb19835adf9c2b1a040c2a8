New York - Two people were injured, one
seriously, in an early-morning fire near the top of Trump Tower
in midtown Manhattan, the New York Fire Department said on
Monday. US President Donald Trump was in Washington at the time. Although local media initially reported there were no
injuries, one person sustained a serious, possibly
life-threatening injury, and another had a minor injury, the
Fire Department said. Eric Trump, one of the president's sons, said on Twitter
that it was a small electrical fire in the cooling tower on the
building's roof. Read: WATCH: Fire on top floor of Trump Tower "The New York Fire Department was here within minutes and
did an incredible job," said the younger Trump. "The men and
women of the #FDNY are true heros and deserve our most sincere
thanks and praise!" The fire was reported by phone shortly before 7 a.m. EST
(noon GMT) on the top floor of the 68-story structure, which had
been Trump's primary residence before his election victory and
inauguration nearly a year ago, the department said. More than 90 minutes after the initial report, 84
firefighters and 26 units were still on the scene, according to
department spokesman Firefighter Ken Reilly.Â   Reuters
