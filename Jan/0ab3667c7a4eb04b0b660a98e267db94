CAPE TOWN -  Ahead of all announcements set to be made at this year's International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) taking place from the 8th- 12 January 2018, Samsung jumped the gun and revealed their Notebook 9 devices.    The devices are as follows:  1. Notebook 9 Pen The Notebook 9 Pen is seen as a 2-in-1 PC because it features a metal chassis and a 360-degree hinge to convert it to a tablet. The Notebook 9 Pen features Intel’s 8th-generation Core i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. The display resolution is 1920 x 1080 and has a HDMI port, a single USB-C port, and a regular USB port. The device will also have a  microSD storage and a Windows Hello camera to sign into Windows 10 with just your face. Its S Pen stylus is battery free and built into the device, added Samsung. 2. Notebook 9 models 13.3-inch and 15-inch Both devices will feature  Intel’s 8th-generation Core i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of SSD storage.The difference is that the 15-inch model will also include an optional Nvidia’s MX150 discrete graphics chip. The 15-inch USB-C port will support Thunderbolt 3, and there’s also an additional USB 2.0 port on the larger model. Both models will feature 1920 x 1080 panels. Each version will have two USB 3.0 ports, a HDMI port, microSD storage, and a single USB-C port. Samsung says that they will be using the “largest and most powerful” battery its ever placed in a laptop in both models.  The 75W Hexacell battery should include a battery life boost, but the company is only committing to a vague “always-on power,” with fast charging support for when you need to top the battery up.  Here are the specifications in detail:
