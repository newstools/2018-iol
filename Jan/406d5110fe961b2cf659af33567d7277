Cape Town - British American Tobacco South Africa (BATSA) has signed an agreement to acquire 100% of Twisp Proprietary Limited, a vapour company based in SA.  BAT said in a statement its aim is to grow the next generation products (NGP) category to offer consumers a choice of alternatives to smoking.  This deal will push foward the company’s goal of expansion into the South African market.  BATSA CEO Soraya Benchikh said Twisp is a leading vaping supplier in SA and that the acquisition will contribute towards BAT's growth and sustainability. “We already have a large footprint elsewhere in the world. We are committed to the growth of our NGP business and it was only natural that we extend our offering in SA with a range that is familiar to this market.
