London - US President Donald Trump said
he had not intended to cause offence in Britain by sharing
anti-Muslim videos originally posted by a leader of a far-right
fringe group and that he would apologise if such people were
horrible racists. Speaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain show, Trump said he
knew nothing about the group but that he was the "least racist
person that anybody's going to meet" and that his retweet was
not an endorsement. Trump sparked outrage in Britain when, last November, he
shared the anti-Muslim videos and became embroiled in a public
spat with British PM May who criticised him for the retweet. When pressed on whether he would apologise for his retweet,
he said that if the group was made up of racists then he would. "Here’s what’s fair, if you’re telling me they’re horrible
people, horrible racist people I would certainly apologise if
you would like me to do that," Trump said. "I know nothing about them. I don’t want to be involved with
people, but you’re telling me about these people because
I know nothing about these people." Trump said he did not mean to cause any difficulty for
Britain, a country he said he loved very much. "I can tell you I have a very good relationship with your
Prime Minister," Trump said. "She’s been doing a very good job.
We actually have a very good relationship, although a lot of
people think we don’t." "I support her, I support a lot of what she does and a lot
of what she says and I support you militarily very much. We will
come to your defence if anything should happen, which hopefully
will never happen. I am a tremendous supporter of the UK." Reuters
