Cape Town - The world's oldest surviving sextuplets were born in Cape Town 44 years ago. The Rosenkowitz sextuplets were born at the Mowbray Maternity Hospital on January 11, 1974. David, Nicky, Jason, Emma, Grant and Liz were the first sextuplets known to have been born alive anywhere in the world. Born four weeks early, their total birth weight was a mere 11 kilograms. Here's how much each of the babies weighed at birth in the order in which they were born: David Peter - 2.0 kg Grant Vincent - 1.8 kg Jason Solomon - 2.0 kg Emma Louise - 1.8 kg Nicolette Anne - 1.2 kg Elizabeth Rebecca - 1.9 kg The sextuplets became instant celebrities with journalists from across the world clamouring to report on the challenges of caring for six newborns. Throughout their early childhood, their progress was closely followed by the South African media.  Their first day of school in 1980 was no different:   All but one of the Rosenkowitz sextuplets are now living abroad, but they are still an important part of our history.  IOL
