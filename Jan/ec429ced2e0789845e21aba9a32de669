Untu has got a majority of members working for the rail agency. A huge number of commuters, especially workers relying on the Central Line trains have been affected. Re-opening the route would mean a decreased traffic volume and lengthyÂ queues at the taxi ranks would revert to normality. The services on the line were suspended after the murder of a security guard on January 10. Riana Scott, the Metrorail spokesperson said that later in January, they will be in a good position to disclose how has this matter affected their ticket sales.
