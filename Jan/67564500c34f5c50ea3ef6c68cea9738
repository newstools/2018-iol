Tripoli - Two car bombings in the Libyan city of Benghazi on
Tuesday killed 27 people and injured 42 others, local hospital
officials have said. Two bombs exploded close to a mosque in the al-Salmani region of the
coastal city. Eyewitnesses said that the first bomb exploded as
worshippers were leaving the mosque. A number of the injured were in a critical condition, hospital
sources said, while a local militia leader was also believed to be
among the victims. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack. A 2011 uprising against former Libyan leader Moamer Gaddafi began in
Benghazi. As a result of the ensuing civil war, the city descended
into chaos and was at times controlled by an alliance of Islamist
militants. Last year, troops of eastern Libyan military leader Marshal Khalifa
Haftar took over control over the port city. dpa
