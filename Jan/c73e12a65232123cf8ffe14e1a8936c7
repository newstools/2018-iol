Scottburgh - No arrests have yet been made after police in the coastal resort town of Scottburgh, south of Durban, discovered a plantation of "hundreds of dagga trees", KwaZulu-Natal police said on Saturday. Captain Vijay Moodley, Sergeant Christopher Mahlawe, and Constables Mxolisi Ngcobo and Zoleka Mhlawuli of the Scottburgh South African police Service (SAPS) carried out a “back to basics” crime prevention operation on Friday, Lt-Col Thulani Zwane said. While "walking beat in the Kelso area they came upon a plantation of dagga", he said. "Hundreds of dagga trees at various stages of growth were plucked out by their roots and removed to a dumpsite for destruction. Nobody was arrested, as the plantation, which was situated deep in the bushes west of the R102 Old Main Road, was away from any dwellings and unattended at the time of its discovery. Most of the trees were ready for harvesting," Zwane said. KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Maj-Gen Bheki Langa commended Captain Moodley and her team "for being observant and pulling out the trees despite the searing heat of the midday sun".  "We will be visiting all the areas under cultivation in the different localities to check if any more dagga is being grown. We are serious about destroying the drugs before they reach the streets where they destroy lives and contribute to crime,” Langa said.  African News Agency
