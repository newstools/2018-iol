CAPE TOWN - If you want to gain relief from the heavy load of debts, the first step to take is, to be honest with yourself, says a certified financial planner, Kim Potgieter. As a debtor, you need to admit to yourself that you have these accounts and not to turn a blind eye as if your debts might flash away with the year 2017.  The South African Law Centre provides the following steps as a typical plan for a consumer to use to face debts head on: 1. List all debts with minimum monthly payments, interest rates and the total balance due. 2. Order them from the lowest total balance due to the highest due. 3. Once your budget works effectively and you have cut non-essential spending, you can add the extra cash to the debt with the lowest balance. With discipline, you will add more each month to that debt. 4. When this debt paid up, you can add all that extra money to the next debt on your list. See how quickly that debt drops. 5. Continue the cycle, until you are more comfortable with your debt levels, or you are totally debt free.
