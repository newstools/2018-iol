London - Police say they are not treating the death of Cranberries singer Dolores O'Riordan as suspicious. O'Riordan was found dead Monday morning at a London hotel. Police initially called the death "unexplained," but said Tuesday that nothing suspicious had been found. The case is being passed to a coroner to determine the cause of death. O'Riordan had suffered mental and physical health problems over the years. The Cranberries cut short a world tour in 2017 because of the singer's back problems. The 46-year-old Irish singer was in London to record vocals for a cover of The Cranberries' hit "Zombie" by Los Angeles rock band Bad Wolves.

"The news of her passing is devastating and my thoughts are with Don, her ex-husband, her children, and her mother," Waite said.
