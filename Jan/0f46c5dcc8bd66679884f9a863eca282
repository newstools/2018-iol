Luxor, Egypt - Egyptian prosecutors have ordered four people to
be detained as part of an investigation into a hot-air balloon crash
that killed a foreign tourist in the southern city of Luxor, a
judicial source said. The detainees, all Egyptians, are the balloon's pilot, the manager of
the balloon airport in western Luxor and two officials of the company
that owns the crashed balloon, the source told dpa. The balloon hit the ground during an emergency landing in the western
section of the historical city on Friday morning, also wounding 15
others, mostly foreign tourists. The dead tourist was a 34-year-old South African man, while the
injured included five Australians, four French nationals, two South
Africans, two Argentinians and a Brazilian. The pilot was also
injured. A team from the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority is investigating
the incident and examining the other balloons owned by the company. Air balloon trips are popular in Luxor, which has many of Egypt's
historical monuments. In 2013, 19 people, mostly foreign tourists, were killed when a
hot-air balloon crashed in the city, prompting a two-month ban on
balloon rides. Tourism is a main source of national income for Egypt. The industry has been hard hit by the unrest that followed the 2011
uprising that toppled Egypt's long-time dictator Hosny Mubarak.  dpa
