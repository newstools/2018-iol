Sydney -Â An Australian terrier crossed 1 500 kilometres from an outback cattle station in Queensland to South Australia after hiding in the back of a passing truck, local media reported Tuesday. Rusty had been staying with owner Laura Scudamore's in-laws on a property outside Goondiwindi while she was on holiday. "Rusty's quite happy there but he makes a habit of sneaking off to the highway and trying to befriend people as they drive past," Scudamore told local broadcaster ABC. The 3-year-old dog sneaked onto the back of a truck that had stopped in the area.   The truck was in the middle of the outback when the driver realised he had a passenger, so he took Rusty home to Snowtown in South Australia. "Thankfully Rusty had a collar on with a number for my in-laws," Scudamore said. The in-laws were contacted and told Rusty had hit the road. Scudamore told the ABC that Rusty was having a "grand old time" with the truck driver's family. His owner is now trying to find a way to get Rusty home, asking for help on social media. dpa
