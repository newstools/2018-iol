Cape Town - Metrorail confirmed that the central line service in Cape Town has been postponed after a train derailed between Heideveld and Netreg on Thursday morning. Regional manager Richard Walker said vandalism could have contributed to the derailment. The line has been shut since last week after a security guard was murdered at Chris Hani station in Khayelitsha. Technicians are on site to repair the track and the recovery process could take several hours, said Metrorail.  Commuters are advised to make alternative arrangements and there are no buses to assist commuters. "We encourage our commuters to utilise social media channels, subscribe to receive text alerts or to contact the City of Cape Town’s Traffic Information Call Centre toll-free service 0800 65 64 63 to ensure they are aware of any last minute changes that may extend the average trip length," said the train service in a statement. Walker called on the public to continue reporting criminal activity and there is a reward of up to R25 000 for any information leading to a conviction. IOL
