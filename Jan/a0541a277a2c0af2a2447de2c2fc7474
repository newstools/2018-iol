Johannesburg - After US President Donald Trump's alleged
remarks that African countries are sh*tholes, a game reserve in
Namibia has made a tongue-in-cheek video promoting the country. The video by the Gondwana Collection Namibia - which runs several
game reserves in the southern African nation - intersperses images of
great beauty with a Trump-like voice-over. "We would like to invite you to come to sh*thole Namibia, one of the
most beautiful sh*thole countries out there," the faux-Trump
voice-over says. "Actually Namibia is such a sh*thole country that we converted about
42 percent of it into various conservation areas, where wild sh*thole
animals can roam freely," it continues, with stunning footage of
ostriches and elephants. "Not only is our country a sh*thole place," the narrator continues, 
"even our elephants are highly qualified to dump large amounts of
shit everywhere." The video shows sweeping desert dunes, starry skies and tourists
enjoying a sunset beer overlooking the game reserve. The video, posted on Youtube and the game reserve's social media
feeds, had received 752,000 views on Facebook by Wednesday. WARNING! This video contains strong language. Viewer discretion is advised.   "You're more than welcome to visit Africa's number one sh*thole
country, known to your president as Nambia," it ends, in reference to
another Trump gaffe. In September the US leader wrongly referred to Namibia as Nambia, at
a lunch with African leaders, causing much mirth on that country's
social media platforms. His most recent remarks last week, which he has denied, were
regarding a discussion about migrants to the US. The president
reportedly said he would prefer immigrants from Norway to those from
"sh*thole countries" in Africa, as well as Haiti, El Salvador. dpa
