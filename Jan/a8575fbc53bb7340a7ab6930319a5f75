One of the easiest ways to learn a makeup technique is to watch online tutorials. Whether you're a beginner looking to create a basic look or simply want to know how to use a makeup brush or a more experienced makeup junkie wanting to try the latest makeup trends. These easy (OK sometimes not so easy) to follow videos can teach you how to contour like Kim Kardashian West or how to get Rihanna's glow. Patrick Starrr, Mario Dedivanovic and Sir John are just a few celebrity makeup artists who share their tips and techniques on how to get their famous looks. I for one can watch 5 different videos to find out how to create just one look. So as you can imagine these makeup tutorials are serious business. How to perfect the art of applying liquid liner isn't something to kid about it. Makeup is meant to be fun though. As a little girl I would watch my mom apply her makeup and I would try to copy her. Do a bit of experimenting of my own. I found these little girls who created their own makeup tutorials. Watching them took me back to the days when experimenting with makeup was just for fun. Take a break from the serious tutorials and have a giggle with these little budding vloggers. Watch 4-year-oldÂ Nevaeh's tutorial on how to do your makeup. Yes it's as simple as that.
