JOHANNESBURG - Getting charged for opting out of an insurance spam will soon become a thing of the past following new rules passed by The Financial Services Board (FSB). The new rules will now allow you to opt out of insurance marketing SMSs for free, which will come into effect in July, later this year.  It is believed that recipients of insurance spam via a phone call, SMS, or voice messages must have the option to opt out of future direct marketing from the company in question. An insurer may not charge the user any fee for “opt-out of advertising” requests.

The insurer and service provider will therefore have to come to an agreement as to how these SMSs are paid for, without charging any cost to the recipients.” You may also be interested in: SA royals get substantial a pay hike - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
