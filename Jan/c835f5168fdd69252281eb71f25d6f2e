Nairobi – Two robbers, one disguised as a nun, raided a forex bureau in Karen, Nairobi, and stole more than R418 000 in different currencies, Kenya’s Daily Nation reported on Monday. The main suspect who was dressed as a nun, and whom the police suspect to also be a woman, told the forex bureau attendant that she wanted to change US dollars into shillings. The "nun" then sprayed the attendant with a substance that rendered him unconscious. In less than a minute, the two had accomplished their mission after forcing the attendant to hand over the money in 15 different currencies. They then walked out of the bureau with the money in bags and made their escape on a motorcycle. Two security guards who were manning the premises told police they could not tell a robbery was taking place inside since there was no commotion. The attendant’s failure to put up a struggle in video footage made the police suspicious. “We have arrested the attendant of the forex because we highly suspect that he may have colluded with them,” said Karen police chief Cunnigham Suiyanka. Suiyanka added that further investigations were being carried out. African News Agency/ANA
