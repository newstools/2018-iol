Harbin, China - Wearing extravagant white
gowns and black suits under thick fur coats, dozens of Chinese
couples have braved freezing temperatures to tie the knot at the
Harbin International Ice Festival in north China. The mass wedding, which saw 34 couples exchange vows in one
of the country's coldest places, was part of the 34th edition of
the festival that began on Friday. "Our encounter was an act of fate. We met in a cafe and
experienced ups and downs in the past year. But snow is pure,
just like our love," said Zhou Yilu, a 26-year-old bride from
the city of Liaocheng. "I feel like this is a very good and new beginning for us,"
she said, adding that she hoped she and her new husband would
"cherish each other and be happy forever". The theme of this year's festival is "Ice Snow Blooming
Garden, Fantastic World". The festival also hosted an international ice sculpture
contest, where more than 60 participants from 14 countries put
their creativity to the test, carving intricate sculptures such
as a phoenix, elk and castles. There has also been a swimming competition with more than
600 participants braving an icy plunge. The Harbin festival, which draws several million tourists
from across China and further afield each year, continues with
various activities and shows until the snow begins to melt in
February.Â   Reuters
