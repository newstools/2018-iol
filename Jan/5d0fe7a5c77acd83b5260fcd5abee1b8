I think bongani will want to show his mom in a one-sided light.#BrendaFassie   — Zola Lasmisi (@zola360degrees) January 11, 2018  Only this two can pull of Brenda Fassie.if is not one of them I’m not watching it. pic.twitter.com/guwWlILi9S  — Mmapula (@Mmaps_ThePro) January 11, 2018  Luckily, SA should get what they want as auditions are open to South Africans. “Open to all South Africans nationally. This initiative essentially will give the opportunity for any female across the country to apply for this challenging and honorable role for the movie, said Showbizbee.  Showbizbee said that the ‘search for Brenda’ would be orchestrated with open auditions which were yet to be confirmed. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
