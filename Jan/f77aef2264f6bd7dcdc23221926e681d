Johannesburg - The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) on Friday said results of DNA tests on the remains of those who perished in the Free State train Crash were ready and will be released to the families of the victims. Earlier this month the Shosholoza Meyl collided with a truck and a car at the Jeneva Level Crossing between Henneman and Kroonstad resulting in the deaths of at least 20 people and injuries to many more. The train was travelling from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg when it crashed on 4 January. Prasa Group Chief Strategy Officer Dr. Sipho Sithole said the details of the DNA results and the exact number of positive identifications would only be made public once the families have been informed. “The families will be briefed at Virginia Council Chambers in the Free State by the responsible authorities, after which Prasa will consult with the families on the type of assistance government will provide to make sure that the deceased receive a dignified burial in accordance with each individual family’s wishes,” Sithole said.
