Tel Aviv - A 16-year-old Palestinian girl who gained
international attention after she was arrested for slapping Israeli
soldiers in a viral video will remain in Israeli detention until the
end of her trial, a military court judge said on Wednesday. According to Human Rights Watch, the trial of Ahed Tamimi could take
months, as the military prosecution plans to summon 18 witnesses. In a video that was widely shared on social media, Tamimi is seen
slapping and hitting two Israeli soldiers after a December 15 protest
in her West Bank village of Nabi Saleh. The teen is now facing 12 criminal charges, including assault and
incitement, stemming from the video and prior incidents. For many Palestinians, Tamimi is a defiant icon who stands up to the
Israeli occupation at weekly protests in Nabi Saleh, while Israeli
politicians condemn the girl as a violent provocateur. More than 300 Palestinian minors are being held in Israeli prisons,
according to B'tselem, an Israeli NGO that alleges rights violations
against Palestinians. Tamimi's case has placed increased scrutiny on Israel's military
court system. Along with assault, the Israeli military prosecution has indicted
Tamimi for statements she made in the December video, in which she
appears to support stabbings, rock throwing, and "martyrdom
operations" -Â an apparent reference to suicide bombings. The Tamimi family, which has hundreds of members, has staged weekly
demonstrations in Nabi Saleh since 2009, after the army restricted
Palestinian access to nearby lands. Members of the Tamimi family have died and been arrested in protests.
