We made a promise that our processes will run smoothly, and today we can announce that our online systems did not fail,” said NSFAS CEO Steven Zwane. In aid of ensuring a smooth process, NSFAS employed more than a hundred graduates as Student Support Officers. In partnership with the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA), NSFAS worked tirelessly to improve their online systems and simplify their online application.  READ: #NSFAS wants answers over student's R14m allowance These interventions were made to ease the application processes for applying for bursaries and loans.  "The patriotism showed by our employees throughout the period is commendable.
