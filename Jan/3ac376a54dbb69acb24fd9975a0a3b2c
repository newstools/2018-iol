West Palm Beach, Florida - A politically prominent Florida eye doctor could get more than 30 years in prison for stealing $100 million (R1.2 billion) in one of history's largest Medicare frauds. A sentencing hearing for Dr. Salomon Melgen resumes Wednesday after a four-week hiatus. Melgen was convicted last April of 67 crimes including health care fraud, submitting false claims and falsifying records. U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra could give the 63-year-old Melgen a life sentence. Prosecutors are asking for 30 years. Melgen's attorneys want no more than 10. Prosecutors said Melgen was the nation's highest-paid Medicare provider for five straight years. Melgen convinced many elderly patients to undergo often painful tests and treatments they didn't need for diseases they didn't have. In a separate case, Melgen is accused of bribing New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Associated Press
