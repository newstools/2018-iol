Beirut - A Syrian monitoring group and paramedics in the northwestern city of Idlib say the death toll from a massive car bombing there on Sunday evening has risen to at least 25. Also, nearly 100 people were wounded. The first-responders Syrian Civil Defense, known as the White Helmets says four children and 11 women were among the 25 killed. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights on Monday gave a higher death toll, saying 34 people were killed, including 18 civilians. The Sunday night bombing targeted the office of Ajnad al-Koukaz, a militant group consisting of foreign fighters mostly from the Caucuses and Russia, according to activists. Idlib is the capital of a province by the same name that is controlled by several rebel factions, including an al-Qaida-linked group. AP
