Paris - Three baboons who went on the run,
prompting the evacuation and closure of a zoo in Paris, ended
their escapade and were returned to their enclosure in the early
hours of Saturday. The Vincennes zoo, shut on Friday afternoon while dozens of
police and zoo-keepers launched a monkey-hunt, said the three -
a baby and two older females - were returned to their enclosure
at 4.15 a.m. (0315 GMT). "The incident is over," the zoo said in a statement. It said
it would reopen to visitors later in the day and was now trying
to establish how the primates got loose in the first place. The alarm was raised on Friday afternoon when a zoo employee
bumped into a baboon in a corridor. Reuters
