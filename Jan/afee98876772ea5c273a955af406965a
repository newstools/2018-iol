CAPE TOWN - The Banking Association of South Africa says the appointment of the new board of directors by deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa is one of the opportunities to place the country back on track for economic growth and job creation. "The new board, under the leadership of the newly-appointed Chairperson, Jabu Mabuza, must move quickly to strengthen the executive team at Eskom, get rid of those in the team under investigation for corrupt activities, address the “going concern” crisis and enable the organisation to play the critical role it must to enable economic growth," a statement issued on behalf of BASA read.
