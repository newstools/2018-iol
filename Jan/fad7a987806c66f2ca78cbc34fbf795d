Cairo - Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has again blasted President Donald Trump, saying the US leader's decision to recognize contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital was "sinful." Abbas, who has openly cursed Trump over his policies, told a conference in Egypt that the US has disqualified itself from continuing as a broker in the long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The long-time opponent of violence said Wednesday that Palestinians "will continue to peacefully pursue our demands until we win back our rights." The Palestinian leader's comments at the Egypt conference on Jerusalem came ahead of a weekend visit to the region by Vice President Mike Pence. Pence is the most senior American official to visit the Middle East since Trump's Jerusalem decision in December. He will visit Egypt, Jordan and Israel but won't meet with Palestinians. AP
