Cape Town – Metrorail on Friday warned Cape Town rail commuters to brace themselves for the reality of longer travelling times in 2018.  Train users will, like motorists, spend a longer time covering the same distance, said regional manager Richard Walker. "The instability and vulnerability of the rail system will continue to limit operational flexibility in 2018: Due to the obsolescence of the infrastructure and trains beyond their design life, in-service failures are a reality and incessant vandalism severely hampers the provision of stable services," he said.
