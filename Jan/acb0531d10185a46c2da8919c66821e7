CALIFORNIA - Apple Inc’s offer to replace flagging batteries at a slashed rate could be a hurdle for iPhone unit sales in 2018 if more users take the deal over upgrading to a new device, Barclays analysts wrote in a note. Apple’s customers have not been very pleased with the company after it said last month, that it intentionally slowed down older iPhones with weakening batteries to prevent the handset from shutting off abruptly. Following consumer outrage, Apple apologised and slashed the price of out-of-warranty replacement batteries to $29 from $79 for iPhone 6 or later models. Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz says 77% of iPhone customers are using iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, and SE, which means even a small percentage opting for battery replacement over upgrade could have a meaningful impact on iPhone sales. The company faces eight lawsuits filed in California, New York and Illinois over the issue. - REUTERS
