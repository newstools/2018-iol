Trier - A driver was stopped by police in Germany
after officers spotted a cockerel riding shotgun beside her. The fully-grown male chicken was sitting in the front passenger's
seat and wearing a seatbelt, police reported in a statement on
Monday. Motorway patrol officers let the woman continue on her journey
because her feathered friend was safely secured in accordance with
the rules of the road, the police said. Sitting in the back were two German shepherds, also securely strapped
in. ALSO READ: Wanted man arrested for biting police dog The 30-year-old woman from the Netherlands explained to officers that
