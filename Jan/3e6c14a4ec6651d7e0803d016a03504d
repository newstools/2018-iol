Attackers change characters in the branding and URL, in this case writing “Netflix” with the Greek letter chi. “We attempted to authorise the Amex card you have on file but were unable to do so,” the message reads. “We will automatically attempt to charge your card again within 24-48 hours. Update the expiry date and CVV (card verification value) for your Amex card as soon as possible so you can continue using it with your account.” The email then contains an “Update Payment” button, which users should not click as this will take you to a hacker website.
