The charges against Ms de Lille are clearly trumped up, for I’ve been hearing year on year that the City of Cape Town achieves a clean audit. If the mayor is corrupt, this auditing process has to be reassessed. It’s hard for me to feel even a tinge of sympathy for the mayor. She has worn too many hats for too long. RELATED: #DeLille: I welcome the opportunity to clear my name As a PAC activist, she had my utmost respect, even though I disagreed with most of what she allegedly believed in. When she started the ID she had my support, for I believed her militant political beliefs could be tailored to make this province work for those who need it most. Then she committed political treason, she cosied up to Helen Zille - colonialist defender-in-chief. Madam mayor, you’ve been recycled one too many times. You, and my dear friend Shaun August, have served the racist agenda that poses as the DA well. Secure in the knowledge that they have the prized “coloured” vote, it's time to replace you with an “ethnic”African. This is another blot on the DA claim of non-racialism: it only knows no race when it suits the agenda of a handful who already own more than a handful. It has long been clear that the DA only cares about the brown folk weeks before an election. As I write this, our volunteers are hard at work informing the intended ill-informed of the need to change our voting pattern. We have to prevail. * Brigadier-General Fadiel Adams, South African Cape Corps, Athlone ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers. Cape Argus
