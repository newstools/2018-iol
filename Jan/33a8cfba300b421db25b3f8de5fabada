Algiers - A 16-year-old German girl missing since early
December has been picked up by Algerian police. The Algerian news site Ennahar Online and other local media reported
on Monday that the girl, from the northern German port city of
Hamburg, had travelled alone to Algeria to be with her 19-year-old
boyfriend. The two were both taken into police custody after being found in the
apartment of the young man south-west of the capital Algiers. According to the Algerian reports, the young man was expelled from
Germany last October after his application for asylum had been
rejected. The reports said heÂ and the girl met in 2015 and that she had
converted to Islam. Pictures in the media showed her in Germany
wearing a black headscarf. By earlier German media accounts, the Hamburg girl had disappeared in
early December. Last week, police launched a public search for her.
The last known contact for her was with her mother via the internet. dpa
