San Francisco â€” A federal appeals court has rejected a lawsuit that sought to hold Twitter liable for the deaths of two US contractors in Jordan in an attack for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said Wednesday the lawsuit failed to establish Twitter accounts used by IS directly caused the men's deaths. The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel upheld a lower court ruling. Lloyd Fields and James Creach were shot and killed in Jordan in 2015 by a Jordanian police captain while training law enforcement officers. Their families argued that IS Twitter accounts were a substantial factor in the men's deaths and that the company should have anticipated attacks. Joshua Arisohn, an attorney for the families, says appeals are being considered. AP
