Paris - Three suspects detained in relation to a jewel heist at
the luxury Ritz hotel in Paris were remanded in custody on Saturday,
a judicial source told dpa.  The gang netted an estimated 4 million euros (4.9 million dollars)
worth of jewellery and watches on Wednesday, according to media
reports. A portion of the loot is said to have been found in a bag, although 
details of its contents and value have not been given.  Radio broadcaster Franceinfo reported that the criminals used axes to
break open glass cases full of jewellery in the hotel's main hall.  There were reportedly five criminals involved in the heist, two of
whom are still at large. The three captured suspects found they could
not allegedly exit the hotel as planned because of a blocked door.
The two who got away were stationed oustide. Situated near the Place Vendome in the centre of Paris, the Ritz
hotel is nestled amid luxury and jewellery stores. The neighbourhood
has seen a number of spectacular robberies through the years.  dpa
