CAPE TOWN - In a bid to promote its brand, snack biscuit, TUC on Tuesday may have bitten more than it can chew. The dry biscuit had some dry humour and some Twitter followers were not impressed. The biscuit company took to twitter to give their tasteless view of the recent listeriosis outbreak. The company tweeted " Some things don’t need polony to taste good. #FillTheGap left by the end of the most iconic relationship in Satafrika”. The recent listeriosis outbreak has so far resulted in 180 deaths, linked to cold meat products. Enterprise has been fingered as the root cause of the crisis and has since pulled all cold meat products off stores shelves. The products which came into question was polony and other processed meats. TUC's post appeared to be poking fun at the listeriosis outbreak and Twitter users were left with a bad taste in their mouths. The executive director of Brand Finance Africa, Jeremy Sampson, said in Business Insider that TUC's campaign was not very desirable. “When people have died, or been ill, don’t go there. They say all is fair in a marketing war, but there are lines you don’t cross.” One of South Africa’s foremost brand experts, Sampson has been advising companies like SAB, Nedbank and Distell for decades. Here is what some users had to say:       TUC then issued an apology on March 15, saying: TUC_ZA extends their apologies for the recent social media post. The post is not indicative of the brand’s opinion or values. We have since removed the post and regret any offence caused.
