Juba - Around 100 armed youths raided a cattle camp in
north-western South Sudan on Monday in an attack that left at least
22 people dead. About 17 others were injured when the assailants from Eastern Lakes
State stole about 90 cattle under gunfire in the village of Tidilo in
Terekeka State, State Minister David Laku Jombe told dpa. "We have confirmed 22 people dead, including women and children,"
Jombe said. Four cattle raiders were among the dead, according to the state
minister. Cattle raiding has occurred for centuries in the East African nation,
and children are sometimes abducted during raids to be used as
domestic slaves. The raids often carry an ethnic component. Monday's attack was
carried out by the Dinka tribe against the Mundari tribe. Despite the signing of various peace accords, South Sudan is in the
midst of a bloody civil war that has taken tens of thousands of lives
since a 2013 split between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy
Riek Machar. dpa
