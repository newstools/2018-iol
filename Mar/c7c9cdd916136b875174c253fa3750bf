Hamburg - An HIV-positive man was sentenced to six years in
prison Tuesday for raping an 82-year-old woman in the northern German
city of Hamburg. The regional court in Hamburg also found the 29-year-old guilty of
deliberate bodily harm and theft. "It's clear from a multitude of unshakable evidence that the
defendant was the perpetrator," the judge said. Among other things, investigators had found the defendant's mobile
phone, which had fallen out of his trousers during the crime, in the
woman's apartment. The court found that the defendant had entered the woman's apartment
through an open balcony door on the morning of July 8. In the following hour he raped the woman five times and attempted
rape a further time. He also stole 100 euros from her before
escaping. The octogenarian suffered numerous injuries and had to undergo HIV
prevention treatment, with severe side effects. She is still
suffering the effects of the crime. The public prosecutor had called for a prison sentence of six years
and ten months, while the defence had proposed a sentence of four or
five years. dpa
