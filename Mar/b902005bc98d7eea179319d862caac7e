Cape Town - Former Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown has quit as ANC MP after she was not retained by President Cyril Ramaphosa in his Cabinet. Brown was one of 10 ministers, linked to the Guptas, who were axed in the Cabinet reshuffle on Monday. The ANC in Parliament confirmed on Thursday that Brown has resigned as party MP. ANC caucus spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli said Brown had thanked the party for giving her the opportunity to serve in government. “Comrade Brown joined the National Assembly in 2014 and previously served as a member of the Western Cape provincial legislature in various capacities from 1994 until 2014,” said Mhlauli. “She has expressed her gratitude in having served the people of South Africa and thanked the ANC for having given her the opportunity to do so,” she said. “We are confident that she will continue serving the country and our movement in other capacities in future. We wish her well,” said Mhlauli. Brown was one of the ministers who was linked to state capture. In the latest testimony in the inquiry into state capture suspended Eskom head of group capital Abram Masango said Brown had failed to act against Matshela Koko. This was after Masango submitted a whistleblower’s report to former board chairperson Ben Ngubane, and before Ngubane acted on Koko Brown intervened. Brown had defended herself in the inquiry against state capture and was fiercely questioned by members of the portfolio committee on public enterprises. IOL
