CAPE TOWN - Cell C has announced that for this Easter weekend, its subscribers on entertainment platform, Black will be able to stream online content for free. Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos said that this offer is a holiday treat for those to experience Black, at zero-rated data.

Although Dos Santos did not disclose the amount of subscribers on Black, he said that Cell C is pleased with the take-up of the service so far and expect continuous growth. “Customers will need to be subscribed to black and purchase content (movies or series) or use the 7-day free trial, but data for Cell C subscribers will be completely free, meaning that when they watch a series or download a movie, they will not use data”, said Dos Santos.
