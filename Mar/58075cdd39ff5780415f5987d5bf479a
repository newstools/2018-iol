Jakartas - A critically endangered
Sumatran tiger was brutally killed in Indonesia on Sunday, the
latest victim of a killing spree targeting near-extinct species
that has alarmed conservationists. Authorities have in recent months found a number of killed
animals, including endangered Borneo orangutans, after conflicts
with farmers or plantation workers. Activists said the tiger had been roaming Mandailing Natal
village in North Sumatra for over a month and had injured one
person, prompting residents to call on rangers to kill it. "We explained to the villagers that the tiger is an
endangered animal...but they didn't like our way of handling
this situation," said Hotmauli Sianturi, of the Natural
Resources Conservation Agency, adding a trap had been used to
try to capture the cat. "We regret that they killed the tiger. We will prove that
its body parts are being traded," she added. An investigation showed it had several parts missing,
including its canine teeth, claws, and skin off its face and
tail. These body parts can be used in traditional medicines or
sold as artefacts. A representative of the village community was not
immediately available for comment. There are only around 400 Sumatran tigers left in the world,
meaning it is on the brink of extinction, according to the World
Wildlife Fund. Police on Borneo island arrested at least two people in two
separate incidents this year in which an orangutan had been
decapitated and another had been shot more than 130 times with
an air rifle.   Reuters
