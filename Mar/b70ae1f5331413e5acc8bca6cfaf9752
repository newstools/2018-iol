Durban - A police officer was expected to appear in the Pinetown Magistrate's Court on Monday in connection with a robbery and the subsequent attempted murder of another officer who pursued him and two accomplices, one of whom was shot dead. According to a statement by the SA Police Service, a 28-year-old woman was walking in New Germany near Pinetown when a vehicle with three occupants stopped next to her and forced her into the vehicle at gunpoint. She managed to escape from the vehicle, after which the suspects fled the scene. "A police officer from Ethekwini Inner and Outer West Cluster Task Team witnessed the incident and pursued the suspects to the Clermont area. The suspects fired shots at the police officer who also retaliated, fatally wounding one suspect," the statement said. "With the help of the K9 Unit, another suspect, who is a police officer stationed at KwaMashu was arrested, while the third suspect managed to flee the scene." KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Bheki Langa said the arrest of the police officer should serve as a warning to other would-be criminals in uniform. "This arrest will serve as warning to other criminals who are hiding behind our SAPS badge," Langa said. "The vast majority of our police officers are principled and will not hesitate to arrest any person who commits crime. Nobody is untouchable." African News Agency/ANA
