CAPE TOWN - Toys R Us South Africa has confirmed that it is unaffected by troubles that its US affiliate is facing. In the wake of Toys R Us US announcing its plans to either sell or close 800 of its outlets, speculation emerged that its SA affiliate would also be affected. This comes after the US retailer last year filed for bankruptcy, citing its failure to pay a nearly $8 billion debt. The closure or selling of its US branches will affect nearly 33 000 jobs.
