Stockholm - Princess Madeleine gave birth to a baby girl in
Stockholm, adding a new member to Europe's largest royal family. "Mother and child are doing well," the Palace said on Friday. The new royal offspring, who was born at 12:41 am Friday morning
(2341 GMT on Thursday) is the third child of Princess Madeline and
husband Christopher O'Neill who is said to have been present during
the birth. "We're very excited about the new addition to our family," said
O'Neill after the birth. Princess Madeleine is the youngest child of King Carl XVI and Queen
Silvia. However Madeline's newborn baby is unlikely to ever ascend to
the throne, as there are already nine in line before her. These include Princess Victoria and her two children; Prince Carl
Philip and his two sons; and her two older siblings Nicolas, aged 2,
and Leonore, aged 4. The Swedish family outnumbers all other European royal families in
terms of offspring. The new princess is the seventh grandchild of the
reigning monarchs in Sweden. Their eldest grandchild, Princess
Estelle, turned six in February. Madeleine and O'Neill, a US businessman, had lived in London and New
York before the birth of their second child. O'Neill stays away from
the royal limelight and even rejected an official royal title after
the couple's wedding in June 2013. dpa
