INTERNATIONAL - Tidal has added a new feature that will let you add albums to your library as soon as they are released. The new “pre-save” feature will allow Tidal users to add albums to their collections as soon as they are uploaded to Tidal’s service ahead of the release date. Tidal is launching the new feature alongside Deadmau5’s new album, which can be pre-saved now and will be officially released next week. The feature is similar to what is offered from Spotify, however on Spotify, the pre-save feature is only used in marketing campaigns by artists and labels and you need a direct link to the album to use it. Pre-save to Spotify campaigns allow fans to connect on Spotify and automatically add an upcoming album or single to their Spotify library when it is released. In most campaigns, fans opt-in to receive email updates from the artist, and it is also possible to send out email notifications to fans when the album becomes available. The reason pre-save campaigns can be so effective is that they allow music labels and artists to promote their streams prior to them being available.
