Johannesburg - A man died after he was run over by his own car in a freak accident at a fast food outlet in Midrand in Johannesburg, paramedics said on Sunday. Netcare 911 paramedics responded at about 1.40am on Saturday to reports of a serious freak accident at the drive-through section of a fast food outlet in the Kyalami area in Midrand, Netcare 911 spokesman Nick Dollman said. "Reports from the scene allege that the victim had parked too far away from the drive-through window. An eye-witness explained that the man then tried to exit his vehicle, and [at] that stage the vehicle moved and drove over the victim," he said. When the emergency services arrived at the scene the man was still underneath the vehicle. Once freed, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated, but the man, in his 50s, succumbed to his severe injuries. The incident was also attended by the fire department and Johannesburg metro police, Dollman said. African News Agency/ANA
