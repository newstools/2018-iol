Johannesburg - Former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe on Wednesday made his first trip to South Africa since stepping down in a coup last year that saw an abrupt end to his 37-year reign. Travelling as an ordinary citizen on a flight from Zimbabwe bound for OR Tambo International Airport in Joburg, the former Zanu-PF leader was accompanied by about eight guards and a woman believed to be a nurse. “One of the guards was on the phone talking about "colleagues from Pretoria,” a passenger who was on the same flight said. He added that when they landed, Mugabe was hidden in the cockpit and that all the guards remained on the plane as they walked out. It is thought that Mugabe is in the country to see his sons who live here as well as to hold meetings with some of his longtime supporters. His wife Grace, who last year courted controversy after allegedly assaulting 20-year-old model Gabriella Engels at a Joburg hotel with an extension cord, was not with him. Grace, who denied assaulting the woman at the time saying she was merely defending herself from an “intoxicated” Engels, was later granted diplomatic immunity and has not made a public appearance in the country since then. The passenger on the flight also revealed that it was delayed. “The plane was supposed to leave Harare at 7am. We only boarded at 10am. No reasons were given.” “When we were about to take off the captain announced that "former President RG Mugabe" was on board and also welcomed him to OR Tambo International,” he said. Back in Zimbabwe, Mugabe is facing a fair share of criticism as the ruling party he once led has warned him to steer clear of meddling with its affairs after it was discovered that he (Mugabe) met with and is backing a new opposition party ahead of this year’s elections. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation spokesman Ndivhuwo Mabaya did not respond to requests for comment. Political Bureau
