Jakarta - A famous Indonesian singer and model has been
criticized for a video taken at the Berlin Holocaust memorial seen as
insensitive to the suffering of the victims of the Nazis. In the video posted Thursday on Instagram, where she has 20.7 million
followers, Syahrini was shown laughing and talking to a friend: "Can
we take photos? Isn't it nice? This is the place where Hitler did the
killings." She also posted a photo of her and a friend standing on one of the
concrete slabs at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in the
German capital. The posts drew criticism from Indonesians on social media, prompting
Syahrini to delete them. "People, don't be like Syahrini. Be as rich and successful as her but
don't be this uneducated," said Twitter user Riyan Wahyudi in a post
that also included the video.    Syahrini said she was visiting Germany for an appointment with a
laryngologist for a vocal check-up. Syahrini is a household name in Indonesia, not only for her singing
prowess, but also for her extravagant lifestyle, which is on display
in her Instagram posts. She regularly posts photos showing her visiting posh places overseas
and wearing luxury items. Syahrini has not publicly commented on the controversy. dpa
