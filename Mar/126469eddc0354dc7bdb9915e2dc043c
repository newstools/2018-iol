Johannesburg - Deputy President David Mabuza used his Human Rights Day address to call for the renewal of public service to better address the growing demands of communities.
 
Mabuza said the commemoration of the Sharpeville massacre should be an opportunity for renewal and unity for government performance.
 
He said he was shocked driving into Sharpeville on Wednesday and seeing that the grave sites of Sharpeville heroes were not being taken care of and that the grass was overgrown.

Mabuza said it was time for renewal and this means changing how people are served and to instill ethical standards.    He said he would prioritise Sharpeville along with Gauteng Premier David Makhura to fix the service delivery issues in the area.    Political Bureau
