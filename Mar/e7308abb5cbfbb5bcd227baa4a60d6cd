INTERNATIONAL - Snapchat now lets you tag someone in your Story, creating a swipe up “more” option that shows the tagged person’s name or handle reported by TechCrunch. The feature could let friends call each other out in Stories, or promote their favorite influencers by making it easy for people to follow them. Snapchat now confirms to TechCrunch that “We’re testing this” but refused to give more details. The feature was spotted by Video Editor of DanaDigitalMedia, Dana Glidden and comedian Matt Rappoport in the US.
