Manila - Ten people died when a small
plane crashed into a house north of the Philippine capital on
Saturday, aviation and police officials said. The Piper 23 Apache single-engined aircraft, operated by
Lite Air Express, had just taken off from a small airport
nearby, said Eric Apolonio, spokesman for the Civil Aviation
Authority of the Philippines (CAAP). It was carrying five people, including the pilot, and was en
route to Laoag in northwestern Luzon. "All plane occupants died in the aircraft accident with
collateral damage to a house with five occupants who also
perished," Apolonio said. The plane hit the house of an 80-year-old woman, who was
inside at the time, police spokesman Chief Superintendent John
Bulalacao said in a text message. "The house was burned while the aircraft was totally
wrecked," Bulalacao said. CAAP ordered all aircraft operated by Lite Air Express to be
grounded pending the result of investigations. Reuters
