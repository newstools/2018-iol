The banking operation recorded a net surplus of 7percent of $42.1m, while gross premiums grew 5percent, bringing total revenue for the period to $991m. “Funds under management (Fum) for the asset management business were up 50percent, from $1.8bn to $2.7bn, largely due to a combination of growth in net client cash flows generated and gains on ZSE-listed equity investments,” said board chairperson Johannes Gawaxab. “As a result of the growth in Fum, fee income and profit ­before tax for the asset management business increased by 28percent and 64percent to $20.6m and $10.7m respectively.” After-tax profits soared 139percent to $219.3m. The company said there was strong operating profit across the business, as well as non-banking investment returns, which grew 448percent - from $116.9m to $640.9m. The insurer also recorded higher profits from its life business, as well as increased long-term investment returns on the back of a higher asset base. Gross premiums underwritten shot up 5percent at $194.8m for the life and short-term insurance businesses, because of “a combination of improved client retention and new business” underwritten for the ­period. However, the short-term insurance business achieved an underwriting ­margin that dropped from 18percent to 13percent. - BUSINESS REPORT
