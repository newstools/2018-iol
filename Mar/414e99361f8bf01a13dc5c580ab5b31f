BERLIN - Members of Germany's Social
Democrats (SPD) voted in favour of a coalition with Chancellor
Angela Merkel's conservatives on Sunday, opening the way to a
new government for Europe's largest economy. Two thirds of the membership backed the deal, a party
official said -- a wider margin than many had expected -- ending
more than five months of political uncertainty after an
inconclusive election. The result is set to hand long-serving chancellor Merkel a
fourth term in office at a time when the European Union is
looking to its largest country for leadership on a host of
economic and security issues. It clears the way for a re-run of the "grand coalition" that
has governed Germany since 2013. Acting SPD leader Olaf Scholz said at the party's Berlin
headquarters: "The vast majority of SPD members followed the
party leadership's suggestion." "We now have clarity: the SPD will join the next German
government," he added. Scholz had said on Saturday turn-out in the poll had been
"very, very high" after an intense internal campaign that pitted
the party's pro-coalition leadership against its more radical
youth wing, which campaigned for "No". The SPD initially planned to go into opposition after a
disastrous result in September's election, but agreed to
negotiate with Merkel's conservatives after talks with the
pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmentalist
Greens on a three-way tie-up collapsed in November. They thrashed out a coalition agreement which SPD leaders
hailed for its commitments to strengthening the EU and giving
them some key government roles Merkel could be sworn in as Chancellor by mid-March. Reuters
