INTERNATIONAL - Snap is reportedly working on a new feature that will let users control which third-party apps will have access to their Snapchat accounts, according to Mashable. The latest beta version of Snapchat features is a new tab in the settings screen called “Connected Apps", reports Mashable. (Image supplied by Mashable) The screen simply has text that reads: “These apps are connected to your Snapchat account. Choose an app to control what it has access to.” Snapchat’s new settings screen is most likely similar to those found on Facebook, Google, and Twitter, where users can control third-party access. Currently, Snap allows the Bitmoji app access Snapchat accounts. Additionally, Snap also has a partnership with Shazam, which allows users to identify music and send music discoveries as snaps to friends. It’s important to note that the screens found were in a beta version and might not even be released. If the beta does go ahead, allowing more third-party apps access to your Snapchat might mean more features, but it would also involve the risk of letting more companies potential access to your data. This happened with Facebook, over the scandal which erupted after news reports revealed third-party firm Cambridge Analytics misused data from as many as 50 million Facebook users.
