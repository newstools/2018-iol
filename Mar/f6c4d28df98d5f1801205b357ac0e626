Johannesburg - Cosatu President Sdumo Dlamini has denied reports that he received a R300 000 bribe from an abalone dealer. Dlamini said he does not understand why reports have emerged claiming he took a kick-back. He said he has not been approached by the police, even though the Hawks have confirmed that they are investigating the bribery allegations. According to the City Press newspaper, the Cosatu president was paid R300 000 by an abalone dealer for his part in arranging a meeting with former president Jacob Zuma. Zuma is alleged to have received R1 million from the dealer as an attempt to persuade him not to fire Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana.

Rival federation SAFTU has called on Cosatu to suspend Dlamini over the allegations. "All those who are accused must have their day in court but if found guilty must be given exemplary sentences given their high-profit roles as workers’ leaders," said the federation. The DA has raised questions over the sale of confiscated abalone and have asked that the process be opened to Parliament scrutiny to avoid allegations of bribery such as the one involving Zuma. “It is clear that proceeds of the sale of confiscated abalone is subsidising the day to day running of the department hence its reluctance to do anything. In doing so, the department is going against established best practice which dictates that the proceeds of crime should be ring-fenced to fight that crime,” said the DA. Political Bureau
