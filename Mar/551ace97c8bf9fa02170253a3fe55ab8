CAPE TOWN - The outbreak of listeriosis may have been caused by a chicken paste, referred to as “white slime”, a meat scientist reportedly told Business Insider SA. According to the report, the processed meat has to contain 75% of a “meat equivalent”. White slime is deboned chicken which is made into a paste. Notably, SA imported 202 million kilograms of “white slime” last year, of which most of it comes from Brazil. This deboned chicken was imported at R4.1 per kg, according to the SA Poultry Association. A professor in meat science at the University of Stellenbosch, Louw Hoffman, told the media company that he thinks that SA polony and vienna products must include some of the “white slime” to keep costs at a low. He added that the struggle of the listeria outbreak may likely have emerged from abroad.
