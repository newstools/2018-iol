Cape Town - The world's biggest event of its kind, The Cape Town Cycle Tour has officially started. For the first time in history, The Cycle Tour has commenced from its new starting point on the Grand Parade. The first race kicked off at 6:15 am.Â  Among some of the dignitaries to welcome the first group was Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, Cape Town mayor Patricia De Lille, and Cape Argus Editor Aziz Hartly.
