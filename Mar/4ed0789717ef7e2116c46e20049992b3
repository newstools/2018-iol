Maseru, Lesotho - Seven people died when a flooded river washed
away a minibus taxi in Lesotho, police said on Saturday. The taxi, filled to capacity with 15 passengers, was trying to cross
a bridge in the district of Thaba Tseka on Thursday when it was swept
away by the Linakeng River, said police spokesman Mpiti Mopeli. Rescue workers began to search for missing passengers
immediately, but heavy rains made the search difficult. Many of the
bodies were discovered along different places on the river's banks on
Saturday morning, said Mpiti. One of those killed in the accident was a woman who had recently
given birth to a baby, the police spokesman said. Parts of southern African have experienced heavy rain for several
days. In neighbouring South Africa, parts of the capital Pretoria
were left without power due to heavy rainfall. dpa
