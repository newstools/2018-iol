CAPE TOWN - The ticks you see next to messages also known as Read receipts are useful as they let us know when our messages are sent through and when someone has viewed them on WhatsApp. A single tick next to a message means it was sent from your end successfully, a double tick means it was delivered to the recipient’s phone, and a blue-shaded double-tick means the person has read your message. However, lately privacy has become a big concern or sometimes you don’t want to respond to a message immediately so everyone has been looking for a way to be a more secretive. To help you, it is possible to turn off read receipts and/or your “last seen” status, but then you don’t get to see those things for other people. How it works: 1. Click the menu button or the three dots above your screen in WhatsApp 2. On iOS, the Settings button is in the bottom-right corner. 3. Select Settings and then choose the Account option 4. You then select the privacy option and you'll see read receipts will be ticked on. 5. To turn it off, untick the option and nobody will know when you've read their messages.
