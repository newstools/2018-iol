Ankara - A group of chefs in Turkey
claimed a world record for the largest baklava on Thursday with
a giant tray of the pastry dessert weighing over half a tonne. The giant baklava was presented at a "Gastronomy Summit" in
Ankara, where dozens of visitors clamoured for a piece. Mehmet Kanbur, who led the group of 14 chefs and is also the
head of Turkey's Mado patisserie chain, said the baklava weighed
518 kilos - more than doubling the previous record - and had
been in the works for six months. The feat was confirmed by a Guinness World Records official
who monitored the event by video link, state-run Anadolu Agency
reported.   Baklava, whose origin is disputed between Turkey and Greece,
is prepared with fresh pistachios or walnuts and a glistening
honey glaze on top of the puffed pastry. "This is, of course, Turkey's achievement, Turkey's
baklava," Kanbur said. "As you know Turkish people are born
eating sweets and die eating sweets... This is what we say to
the whole world: eat sweet, talk sweet," Kanbur said. "This record is a sweet message to the world. Let's not talk
fighting, let's talk sweet." Reuters
