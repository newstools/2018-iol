Barnstable, Mass â€” Two men authorities say used a Massachusetts home belonging to members of the Kennedy clan for a drug-dealing operation without the owners' knowledge have pleaded guilty. The Cape Cod Times reported that Troy Monteiro and Trevor Gonsalves-Rose were sentenced to up to five years and up to four years in prison respectively after pleading guilty Tuesday. Prosecutors say the Falmouth men used the Hyannisport home to cut, weigh and package fentanyl, heroin and cocaine. The house is owned by an LLC that lists Robert Sargent Shriver III as manager. He's the son of the late Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver. Police say no one in the Shriver family had knowledge of the drug operation. The home's hired caretaker faces charges that she allowed the defendants to use the home. Associated Press
