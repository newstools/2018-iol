London - Police are investigating a
suspicious substance at the British parliament in Westminster,
with two people taken to hospital as a precaution. Police said they were investigating reports of a suspicious
package at the Norman Shaw Buildings, where many lawmakers have
their offices, on the parliamentary estate. "We are aware of a potential situation involving a
suspicious substance which the Met Police are investigating," a
spokeswoman for parliament said in a statement. "There has been no evacuation, but the affected area has
been cordoned off." Last month, police investigated white powder sent to an
office in parliament, which was later found to be
harmless. Police said specialist officers were assessing the
suspicious package on Monday. "London Ambulance Service attended and two people, a man and
a woman, have been taken to hospital as a precaution," they
said.  Reuters
