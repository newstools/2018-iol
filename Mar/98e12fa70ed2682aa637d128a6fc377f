Johannesburg - Disgruntled Free State African National Congress members gathered outside the ANC headquarters on Monday morning unhappy with the newly established provincial task team (PTT). Members rejected the newly appointed PTT set up to lead the province to fresh elections and labeled it as the secretary general Ace Magashule’s camp. Singing and ululating, over 50 ANC members in their political party regalia held up placards saying “Magashule must go,” and “To hell with Magashule and the PTT”. Irvin Riet and Free State sub-region Matjhabeng municipality's Elijah Barayi branch secretary told The Star that Magashule wanted to host another provincial executive committee (PEC) conference on the March 17 with the same branches that attended the December nullified PEC conference. “So many branches in the Free State are still left behind. We are actually worried and dissatisfied about the composition of the PTT in the Free State because we can see that it represents a particular faction only,” said Riet. “In fact the very same members who were part of the last provincial conference are the very same PEC members are the ones who are part of the [current] PTT.  For us it is not inclusive,” said Riet. Five different regions from the Free State vowed to remain outside Luthuli House until their grievances are heard. According to Riet there was a delegation currently in talks with leadership in the ANC headquarters. “This is a Magashule camp who are not interested in solving our problems in the Free State." The PTT are the same people who do wrong things in the province,” said Riet. The Star
