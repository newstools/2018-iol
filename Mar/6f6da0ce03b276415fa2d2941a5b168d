CAPE TOWN - Twitter has officially launched its Bookmarks feature to the world.  As previously reported, the feature gives users a new way of saving tweets they like and giving them an option to revisit it at a later stage. The Bookmarks or a “save it later” feature has been a top request among users according to Twitter. Before, saving a tweet could only be done by liking a tweet, but now you can save them without tapping the heart and directly engaging with a tweet. Another difference is that with Bookmarks, only you know you’ve saved something and no the other user can see. How it works: 1.  Tap or click the new share icon beneath a tweet. 2. The new icon is where the DM icon was previously. 3. Your Bookmarks are accessible in the main slide-out menu. Bookmarks is available on Twitter for Android and iOS, Twitter Lite, and the mobile Twitter website. Additionally, Twitter used this update to add several sharing options to one place. This means that users can now share a tweet via direct message, share it elsewhere outside of Twitter, or bookmark it.
