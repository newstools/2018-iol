Over 30 000 cyclists took on the 109 kilometre route around the peninsula in what was described by many as 'perfect conditions'. "The women’s race saw a pioneering first when the elite and u23 women riders were offered the option of a 76 kilometre race, starting in Glencairn. This shorter route ensured a clear run all the way to the finish for the women." Nolan Hoffman of BCX won his third title at 40th Cape Town Cycle Tour and Demacon’s Kim le Court won the Cape Town Cycle Tour women’s race. IOL
