Together, we have built an icon on Florida Road, and will forever be remembered as a place where families gathered, couples swooned and food flowed with incredible passion. Our core value is one of inclusion and everyone, no matter who, had a seat at the table. Itâ€™s been a great run, and we want to go out with a bang. Saturday night will be our last dinner service and Sunday we officially close at 2pm. We are going to take the time to be with our famiglia on Sunday afternoon.
