Tripoli - The mayor of the Libyan capital of Tripoli has been
kidnapped by unknown gunmen, the city council said on Thursday. Gunmen stormed Abdel Raouf Bait al-Mal's house in the south-eastern
part of Tripoli in the early hours of Thursday, the council said. Sources told dpa that the gunmen had beaten Bait al-Mal's children
before abducting him. The city council added that it would be suspending work until further
notice following the abduction. Libya has been mired in anarchy since the 2011 armed revolt that
toppled long-time autocrat Moamer Gaddafi. The oil-rich country is divided between two rival administrations:
one in Tobruk and the other in the capital, Tripoli. dpa
