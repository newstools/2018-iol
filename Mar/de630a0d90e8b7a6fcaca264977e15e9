CAPE TOWN - Healthcare plans have been unaffected by tax hikes in the latest budget speech. Most South Africans will be more relieved to know that affordable medical aid schemes and hospital plans do exist. Take a look at SA’s cheapest medical aid plans, according to a report on Business Tech. Personal Finance has also reported in December last year that the South African healthcare industry has been difficulty these past few years, with medical schemes facing escalating healthcare costs. A study released this week by Alexander Forbes found that medical inflation (medical care and health expenses inflation) will be about 2% to 3% higher than Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation over the long term. CPI inflation has averaged 5.8% a year over the past 17 years, while medical inflation has averaged 7.6%, resulting in an average gap of 1.8% a year. Roshan Bhana, the head actuary of technical and actuarial consulting solutions at Alexander Forbes Health, says the average contribution increases for the top nine open medical schemes have been well above CPI since 2007. “Increases announced for 2017 were higher than in prior years because of a significant increase in the use of in-hospital benefits reported by many schemes. “However, the contribution increases for 2018 are lower, in part because of lower CPI inflation in 2017,” Bhana says. Alexander Forbes says medical inflation has been higher than CPI for the following reasons: • High increases in the fees charged by healthcare service providers. • The rising burden of disease. (A disease burden is the impact of a health problem as measured by financial cost, mortality, morbidity, or other indicators.) • The increase in hospital admission rates. • Medical scheme members making greater use of benefits. • The development of new medical technologies. • The statutory requirement that schemes maintain reserves of at least 25% of their gross contribution income. • Medical schemes enhancing their benefits.
