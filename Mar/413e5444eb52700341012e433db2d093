She went on to launch Mmakau Mining, a successful business with interests in gold, platinum, coal, ferrochrome, and uranium assets.

Do your bit to ensure that the future for girls is bright, equal, safe and rewarding. Adri Senekal de Wet is the managing editor of Business Report and Personal Finance. -BUSINESS REPORT
