CAPE TOWN - Facebook followers stormed to Twitter, creating an anti-support campaign against social networking site, Facebook for its recent data breach, by hashtagging #DeleteFacebook.

Cabridge Analytica is being accused of stealing Facebook data of thousands of users. Recently, it was also revealed that the social networking had harvested users information including call logs and text messages. Some users discovered the Silicon Valley giant had been storing complete logs of incoming and outgoing calls and text messages.Â Others reported that data such as contacts in their address books, social events in their calendars and even friends' birthdays had been stored. Notably, South African-born businessman and CEO of aerospace company, Space X, Elon Musk has also jumped onto the #DeleteFacebook bandwagon. Verified Facebook pages of SpaceX and Tesla disappeared on Friday, minutes after Elon Musk responded to a comment on Twitter calling for him to take down his rocket company SpaceX, electric carmaker Tesla and his own official pages in support of the #deletefacebook movement.
