London - It is "highly likely" that Russia was behind the
poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain, Prime
Minister Theresa May said on Monday. Experts have confirmed that the poison used against Sergei Skripal
and his daughter was a "military-grade nerve agent developed by
Russia," May told parliament. May said her government had summoned the Russian ambassador to London
and demanded an explanation for the presence of the nerve agent,
promising to discuss with parliament potential action against Russia
"should there be no credible response." May said there were only two possible reasons for the detection of
the Novichok nerve agent: that it was used in "a direct action by the
Russian state" or because of Russia "losing control" of its stocks of
the poison. ALSO READ: British PM May weighs in on nerve attack against Russian spy ALSO READ: Former Russian spy still seriously ill after nerve agent attack DPA
