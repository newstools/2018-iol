LONDON - British physicist Stephen
Hawking is to take his place among some of the greatest
scientists in history when his ashes are interred inside
Westminster Abbey, close to the graves of Isaac Newton and
Charles Darwin. Hawking, the world's most recognisable scientist, died last
week aged 76 after a lifetime spent probing the origins of the
universe, the mysteries of black holes and the nature of time
itself. Ravaged by the wasting motor neurone disease he developed at
21, Hawking was confined to a wheelchair for most of his life.
As his condition worsened, he had to speak through a voice
synthesiser and communicate by moving his eyebrows. Westminster Abbey, the final resting place of 17 monarchs
and of some of the most significant figures in British history,
said on Tuesday it would hold a Service of Thanksgiving for
Hawking later this year, during which his ashes would be
interred. "It is entirely fitting that the remains of Professor
Stephen Hawking are to be buried in the Abbey, near those of
distinguished fellow scientists," said the Dean of Westminster,
John Hall, in a statement. Newton, who formulated the law of universal gravitation and
laid the foundations of modern mathematics, was buried in the
abbey in 1727. Darwin, whose theory of evolution was one of the most
far-reaching scientific breakthroughs of all time, was buried
close to Newton in 1882. Interment inside Westminster Abbey is a rarely bestowed
honour. The most recent burials of scientists there were those
of Ernest Rutherford, a pioneer of nuclear physics, in 1937, and
of Joseph John Thomson, who discovered electrons, in 1940. Hawking's death last week was met with tributes from around
the world. Reuters
