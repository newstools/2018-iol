Boise, Idaho - A serial bank robber nicknamed the "Great Outdoors Bandit" because witnesses described him as outdoorsy has been sentenced to more than five years in prison and ordered to pay $31 000 in restitution. Thirty-two-year-old Josue Daniel Alfaro of Portland, Oregon, received the sentenced Tuesday in US District Court in Boise. Bank security cameras caught images of him wearing flannel shirts and jeans and a hat promoting Cabela's, the big US retailer that sells hunting, fishing and camping supplies. He was arrested in August at Los Angeles International Airport trying to board a flight for Belgium.   Alfaro in December pleaded guilty to robbing five banks in southwestern Idaho and a credit union in Orem, Utah. He also pleaded guilty to attempted robbery at another southwestern Idaho bank. AP
