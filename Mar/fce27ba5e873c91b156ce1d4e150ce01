Riyadh - Saudi Arabia's top religious
body accused Qatari-owned Al Jazeera TV of being a "mouthpiece
for terrorist organisations", two days after Yemen's Houthi
movement fired a barrage of missiles at the kingdom. The first direct condemnation by the influential state
religious body of the pan-Arab TV channel ramps up Riyadh's
10-month-old feud with Doha as tensions with Iran mount. "History will not forget that Qatar's Al Jazeera was and
still is a platform for the propagandists of terrorism and its
leaders," the body said in a statement carried by Saudi state
news agency SPA. "It is now ... spreading the speeches of the leader of
Houthi terrorist militias in coordination with him in a clear
targeting of the security of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia". A spokesperson from Al Jazeera did not immediately respond
to a Reuters request for comment. Saudi forces said they had shot down three missiles over
Riyadh shortly before midnight. Air defences also repelled
missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and
Khamis Mushait, the coalition said. The Houthi group, which hails from a Shi'ite Muslim sect, is
aligned to Sunni Saudi Arabia's regional rival Iran. Saudi
military spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said on Monday that
the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis reserved the right
to respond to Iran "at the appropriate time and manner". The standoff over the TV channel lies at the heart of a
dispute that led Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt
and Bahrain to cut travel and trade ties with Qatar in June,
accusing it of backing Islamists and their arch-foe Iran. They say Qatar uses the channel as a mouthpiece to attack
them and back Islamist groups across the Arab world and has
demanded it be closed down, while Doha insists it is independent
and offers uncensored debate absent on other Arab networks. On Monday, Qatar condemned the attacks on Saudi cities as "a
violation of international law". Reuters
