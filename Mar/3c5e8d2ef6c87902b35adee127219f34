Wafideen checkpoint, Syria -Â The Red Crescent prepared to evacuate people in desperate need of medical care from Syria's battered rebel enclave of Eastern Ghouta on Tuesday, multiple sources said. The expected evacuations come in the fourth week of a blistering Russia-backed government assault on the last rebel bastion near Damascus. The rebel faction controlling Eastern Ghouta's main town of Douma and a military source said patients would be evacuated on Tuesday. "A group of critical medical cases will be evacuated with those accompanying them via the Wafideeen" checkpoint into government-held territory, the head of Jaish al-Islam's political office, Yasser Delwan, said.

It said they included around 80 priority cases.

Eastern Ghouta's 400 000 residents have been living under government siege since 2013, facing severe shortages of food and medicines shortages even before the latest assault. AFP
