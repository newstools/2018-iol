Toronto - Toronto police have found a seventh set of remains related to their serial killer case investigation. A police source confirmed the seventh victim to The Associated Press early Monday. The official says alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur has not been charged with a seventh count of murder yet. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak ahead of a news conference later Monday where police and a forensic pathologist will provide an update. Police previously announced they found the dismembered remains of six individuals this year in large planters at a home where McArthur did landscaping work and that he used as storage. Investigators have identified three sets of remains so far. McArthur has been charged with six counts of murder. Read: Could an elderly landscaper be one of Canada's worst serial killers?
