Bremerhaven, Germany - A male lover hidden in a wardrobe caused
two police interventions in the northern German port city of
Bremerhaven. A 38-year-old woman was determined that her partner should not
discover the man hidden in the wardrobe "at any price," a police
spokesman said on Monday. She would rather have been arrested than
found out, he said. She took the new man back with her at the weekend. When her partner
came home on Sunday morning, she started a screaming match with him
while the lover hid. Concerned neighbours called the police. As police officers tried to calm the couple down, they became more
enraged and lashed out at the police, leading to their arrest. Shortly after that, police were called again as the man who had been
hiding in the wardrobe could not get out of the locked flat and had
called some friends who tried to kick the front door in. dpa
