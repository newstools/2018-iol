Harare - Two job-seekers died at the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport during a recruitment exercise, the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (Caaz) said on Wednesday. There was reportedly a stampede on Tuesday, during the recruitment exercise that left seven other people injured. “The Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe has been in the process of recruiting trainee aviation security officers. The recruitment is part of the authority’s efforts to equip its aviation security department with manpower in accordance with international civil aviation organisation requirements,” Caaz spokesperson Anna-Julia Hungwe said. “It is with deep sorrow and heavy hearts that we announce that during the recruitment exercise, two potential male candidates suffered some medical casualties as a result of the road run. The deceased passed on at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, where they had been ferried to receive medical care.” Hungwe did not mention the stampede or that there were those injured and hospitalised. Also, the names of the deceased were not released. She said they had informed the deceased’s families and Caaz was “working closely with the bereaved families during these trying times”.
