CAPE TOWN ‚Äì Mobile Network Cell C experienced a nationwide outage over the weekend¬†after the Neotel Data Centre experienced a power surge due to load shedding.     Cell C has identified the fault that affected data and voice services on its network for approximately 2 hours on Saturday. A Data Centre experienced a power surge due to load shedding, which tripped the air-conditioning. This problem resulted in users not having any signal which caused frustration and consumers took to social media to inquire about the problem.     This resulted in the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) system, that enables the routing of traffic on the network, to overheat and power down. Additional generators have been deployed and the equipment has been restored. According to Cell C, its service was down for two hours on Saturday December 1 but some users stated that their service was down for longer. In a response via Twitter, Cell said: "Cell C has identified the fault that affected data and voice services on its network for about two hours on Saturday. A Data Centre experienced a power surge due to load shedding, which tripped the air-conditioning." After the issue was resolved, the company then decided to gift users with a free 1GB of data which will be valid until Thursday the 6th of December. Cell said in¬†a tweet: ‚ÄúWe want to thank our customers for their patience during the unprecedented network outage earlier today. To show our appreciation, we will provide each customer with 1GB of data valid for 5 days. We will notify you of when data will be loaded. Again, our sincere apologies.‚Äù     We want to thank our customers for their patience during the unprecedented network outage earlier today.
