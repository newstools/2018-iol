Cape Town - State power utility Eskom said on Wednesday it would implement rotational power cuts from 9 am to 10 pm as a result of a shortage of capacity due to a number of generating units still being out of service due to breakdowns. "Our maintenance teams continue to work hard to bring the units back to service," it said, urging residents to treat all electrical points as live during load shedding. The Stage 2 load shedding measure to be implemented on Wednesday involves reducing a 2 000 MW load from the national grid to protect the power system from a total collapse. Eskom urged households and businesses to help reduce demand by, among other measures, switching off geysers and other non-essential lighting and electrical appliances. This is the sixth consecutive day Eskom has announced load shedding, with the power utility warning that the entire week could be constrained if it was "unable to replenish the diesel and water reserves, and reduce the high unplanned outages".
