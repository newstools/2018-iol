Washington - He's still the government's best showman. Surrounded by political chaos, with the government verging on shutdown and legal cases coming in from every direction, US President Donald Trump delivered comic relief when he posted a video Thursday of himself singing a cornball duet from an old sitcom. The 13-year-old video from an Emmy Awards broadcast shows the New York born-and-bred, cow-country adverse real estate billionaire dressed as a farmer in denim overalls and a straw hat, wielding a pitchfork while singing the theme song from the popular 1965-1971 show "Green Acres." In the show, actors Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor played Central Park highrise-dwellers who move to a country farm, with Albert happily bumbling as a planter and Gabor finding it difficult to give up New York society life, in a part that may have fit similarly Slavic-accented Melania Trump to a tee. In a faux talent show for the 2005 Emmys show, Trump reprised the "Green Acres" duet with actress Megan Mullally, then the star of the popular "Will and Grace." "Land spreadin' out so far and wide, Keep Manhattan, just give me that countryside," he sang, answered by her "New York is where I'd rather stay, I get allergic smelling hay."     Farm Bill signing in 15 minutes! #Emmys #TBT pic.twitter.com/KtSS17xvIn The duet worked: they won the Emmys contest. Trump brought back the video to mark the week's most - or perhaps only - uncontroversial act in Washington, the signing of the $867 billion Farm Bill. It served to ease tensions momentarily in the US capital just as Trump locked horns with Congress over another issue, his demand for money to build a border wall. With a Friday midnight deadline, the White House threatened to shut down the government days before Christmas over the issue if Trump doesn't get his wall budget. But bringing the old video back didn't make everyone grin. Mullally, politically no fan of the president, tweeted: "Omg.. if you guys need me, I'll be in a hole in the ground."     if you guys need me, i’ll be in a hole in the ground 😵💀👋🏽
