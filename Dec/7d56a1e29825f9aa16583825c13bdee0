DURBAN - As the festive season approaches shopping malls and retailers will be extending their tradingÂ hours to accommodate their customers. Chief Economist for the Efficient Group Dawie Roodt, in a South African Council of Shopping Centres statement, said that more money was spent over the 2017 festive season compared to the rest of the year According to Roodt, consumers spend more over the festive period because of factors like better marketing and relatively low-interest rates. He added that developments like Black Friday have also contributed to the spending binge. Black Friday has been reported as a busy shopping day but shopping malls are still expecting busy trading days in the second half of December. The Business Report spoke to three malls across the country to find out about their extended trading hours Canal Walk, Cape Town The extended trading hours at Canal Walk has already started and will run until the 23rd of December.
