Cape Town - The National Prosecution Authority has reportedly decided to charge Marius Fransman with alleged sexual assault. TimesLive reported that the former ANC Western Cape chairperson was informed about the charge on Friday. The charge relates to allegations made by Louise Wynand in 2016. In January 2016, Wynand, from Stellenbosch, had accompanied Fransman and three of his friends in a car to the ANC’s birthday celebrations in Rustenburg. It was reported that Wynand was allegedly “forced” to sleep next to Fransman in Kimberley while they were staying at a hotel. Fransman allegedly touched her while two others were seated in the back of the vehicle. In November 2016 the ANC's national disciplinary committee (NDC) found Fransman guilty on two counts of misconduct – one for abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand, and another for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute. The party said the NDC found both charges to be “very serious” and suspended his ANC membership for five years. siyavuya.mzantsi@inl.co.za IOL and Cape Times
