North West - Certain sections of Sun City Resort in the North West will be open on Sunday for day visitors and hotel guests as mopping up operations continue after the resort was hit by a severe hail storm earlier this weekend, chief operating officer Thabo Mosololi said on Sunday. "Sun City can confirm that Sun Central and the Valley of the Waves will be open today [Sunday] for day visitors and hotel guests," he said. In a statement earlier, Mosololi said the situation at the resort was under control and mopping up operations were underway. "Sun City Resort can confirm that a freak hail storm which hit the North West region of the Pilansberg and surrounding areas around 4.30pm yesterday [Saturday] afternoon has caused damage to buildings and vehicles. The resort can confirm that the situation is serious but under control," he said. Most of the damage was caused by flash flooding at the Sun Central family and entertainment precinct and in ground floor hotel rooms. Visitors intending to travel to Sun City were advised to first check with the respective hotels they were booked in to before travelling to the resort. By midnight on Saturday, the estimated number of rooms affected included 80 rooms at the Soho Hotel, 40 rooms at the Cabanas, 30 at the Cascades Hotel, 26 at the Vacation Club, and 20 at The Palace, Mosololi said. Day visitors were immediately evacuated from Sun Central and Sun Welcome Centre which sustained most of the storm damage, and they were bused back to their vehicles at the main car park. "The resortâ€™s emergency services are on the ground and are continuing to assess the extent of the damage. Contingency plans are in place, and mop up operations are underway in damaged hotel rooms and public areas to ensure that normal operations resume as soon as possible." Guests whose accommodation was affected were being provided with alternative options. Some guests opted to leave the resort to return home. New visitors arriving at the resort were being advised to return home. "Two people sustained injuries from slipping on wet floors. They were treated at the onsite clinic before being transferred to nearby hospitals," Mosololi said. African News Agency (ANA)
