 End of the road for Tom Moyane. Or not?   Hopefully this will be the last time I ever have to read about Tom Moyane. Maybe, just maybe he will go off into the sunset like Brian Molefe.   South Africa wants to move on. South Africa deserves to move on. Tom Moyane must voetsek man. Haai!   Tom Moyane's lawyer was "cautiously optimistic" this morning. For himself writing fees that is. Not for #UncleTom. Whatever will #CigaretteSmugglers do next???   That was a smackdown of judgement by the courts for Tom Moyane.Dali Mpofu is using the courts to insult the president and judge nugent through Tom Moyane and the judge was correct to label it abomination and abuse of courts....disgusting!!#TomMoyane   I strongly believed that Tom Moyane would win this case on the basis that you can not run two parallel processes that will decide on a person's fitness to hold office. It was a witch hunt and unconstitutional.
