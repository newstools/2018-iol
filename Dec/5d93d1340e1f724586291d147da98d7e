Sydney - Australia's largest city was picking up the pieces on Friday after a series of lightning and hailstorms pummelled cars with ice blocks the size of tennis balls. The authorities issued a severe storm warning, but that was not enough to prevent damage that is already running into the tens of millions of dollars. "As of 6:30 am we are at 15 00 claims and AUS$80 million in damages," the Insurance Council of Australia told AFP. When the storms hit, Sydneysiders looked on in desperation as cauliflower-shaped hail smashed through car windshields and turned the Harbour into a bubbling and splashing cauldron. Many drivers sought refuge under roofed petrol stations and a few brave surfers in the water at the city's famed Bondi Beach hid under their boards.     This Sydney hail is some of the weirdest-looking hail I've seen. Terrifying, obviously, but so fascinating! Some look almost like flowers or little tiny planets. And literally 5 minutes after the giant hail, the weather returned to humid & sweltering.
