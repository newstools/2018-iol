CairoÂ  - Egypt is investigating a video that shows a Danish couple illegally climbing to the top of the Great Pyramid of Giza and posing naked for pictures. Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani on Friday filed a memo on the incident with the prosecutor general for investigations, state-run al-Ahram newspaper reported, citing a ministry statement. In the video a man and woman are seen climbing to the top of the Great Pyramid of Giza, with a still image at the end showing them in a nude embrace. It's unclear if the couple is still in the country. Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, was quoted by al-Ahram as saying that the prosecutors will decide if the video and the picture were doctored. The three-minute video, which was uploaded to YouTube earlier this week, has stirred outrage among Egyptians. "A scandal took place at the top of the pyramid," one Twitter user said. "How could they climb the Pyramid, they might have paid a bribe to the guards!" he added.
