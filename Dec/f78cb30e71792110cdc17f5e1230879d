Buenos Aires - The Group of 20 annual summit enters its second and final day on Saturday amid hopes the meeting can produce a joint communique that promotes commercial links between nations. A dinner meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will be closely watched. The world's two largest economies are engaged in a brewing trade war but Trump has hinted there might yet be a chance to reach a deal to at least stall any further tariffs. Trump will also meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who arrived late to the summit after technical problems with her plane. The focus on the one-on-one meetings highlights how the G20 forum has shifted to a venue offering world leaders a chance to meet, as multilateralism has moved onto the back burner. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was Friday able to show he was not internationally isolated after the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul in October. The heir to the Saudi throne held a serious of meetings, including with President Vladimir Putin, Xi, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanual Macron during the first day. He had met India's premier Modi the night before. Representatives of the G20 nations, which make up more than 80 per cent of the world's economy and global trade, have been working this week on a joint statement to close the summit. Much attention will be paid to the language on trade in any final statement. A recent Asia-Pacific summit saw a stand-off between the US and China: The meeting was unable to produce a joint communique.
