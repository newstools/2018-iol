Uber said in a statement: "While we have always tried to keep prices as low as possible, we need to be aware of the increased costs for driver-partners. This comes after implementing an in-depth earnings review to ensure that the Uber app continues to be a reliable economic opportunity for drivers, as well as an affordable option for riders."

My calculator tells me that is a SEVEN per cent increase. @Uber_RSA   Okay, thanks. *deletes app*  After a petrol price DECREASE? Nah, this doesn’t make sense. & 5%? Nah. Economic opportunities should come from Uber as a company, not the customers. We already do that by merely supporting the Uber concept. #uber needs to rethink it’s game plan otherwise #taxify it will be 👍🏽   we're taxifying now chief. sala le increase ya hao.   Taxify it is. Thank you for your service 👊🏽   Conveniently before the festive season starts so their surge charges can bankrupt us. Also, “Safer services for riders”?! 😂😂   Did you not increase fees not so long ago! After charging ppl ridiculous amounts over the weekend. Do you not think this is unnecessary?
