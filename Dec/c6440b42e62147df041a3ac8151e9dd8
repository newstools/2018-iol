Pretoria  - As the festive season draws nearer, with millions of South Africans heading to different destinations, National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole on Friday warned members of the public to be constantly alert and avoid falling victim to criminals. "It is common knowledge that the Christmas holiday period is traditionally a time for relaxation and festivities, but unfortunately is also a period when complacency seems to set in and criminals become opportunistic," said Sitole. "This is also a period when there is a greater tendency of abuse of alcohol and drugs, ultimately resulting in the abuse of women, children and other vulnerable groups, aggravated robberies, assaults and an increase in carnage on our roads." Sitole said now that the festive season operations are in full swing, joint law enforcement agencies have been mobilised and resources have been prioritised, with a focus on high police visibility and planned operations across the country. "The South African Police Service has, together with other security and government agencies, committed to ensuring a safer festive season to ensure that people are and feel safe," said Sitole. "We are focusing primarily on aggravated robberies, crimes against women, children and people with disability, proliferation of arms and ammunition, border security, liquor outlets and road safety enforcement. The police chief has shared the following safety tips: On general awareness:   When calling the SAPS HOTLINES 10111 (EMERGENCY) 08600 10111 (CRIME TIP-OFFS):   Regarding vehicles, Sitole said:   Regarding the use of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)   On shopping:   When you are at home:   "Remember to be extra cautious and vigilant and to share these safety tips with family and friends," said Sitole.
