Manila - Six people were killed when a 10-wheeler truck lost its brakes and rammed into more than a dozen vehicles before crashing into a bakery in the Philippines, police said Sunday. Fourteen people were also injured in the accident that occurred late Saturday along a national highway south of Manila, in Laguna province. The victims - three children aged 1, 2 and 17, and three adults - died at the site of the accident, said Senior Superintendent Eleazar Matta, the provincial police director. The driver of the truck escaped before police and paramedics arrived at the site, Matta said. Investigators said the truck apparently lost its brakes. "The truck was too fast," said investigator Daniel Bahiwag. "The other vehicles were caught in a traffic jam, when suddenly the truck rammed into them." Some of the vehicles struck by the truck also slammed into an electric post, Bahiwag added.
