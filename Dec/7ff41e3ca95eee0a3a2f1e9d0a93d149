DURBAN – More South Africans prefer to do their festive shopping online to avoid the mall rush, but this spike in online shopping marks ideal hunting ground for cybercriminals. Consumers doing their festive shopping online could be at risk of losing up to R70 000 per incident to cybercrime according to IT group, Dimension Data. According to the South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC), South Africa has the third highest number of cybercrime victims worldwide, losing about R2.2 billion a year to cyber attacks. According to Maanda Tshifularo, Head of Dialdirect Insurance: “Cybercriminals take the holiday season seriously and prepare well in advance for their online shopping sprees. The reasons are easy to understand: there is an increase in online shopping, meaning an increase in credit card and other personal information available for stealing.  Criminals take advantage of shoppers who throw caution to the wind and click on links that promise never-to-be-seen-again deals. Click the link and you've downloaded malicious software. Your computer or phone is now compromised by criminals.” To protect yourself against cybercrime, Dialdirect offers the following advice:   Tshifularo continues: “Although vigilance is key in preventing and limiting these attacks, and cyber security is constantly evolving to address the ever-changing methods of cyber attack, having adequate cyber insurance in place is imperative in a technologically booming South Africa.
