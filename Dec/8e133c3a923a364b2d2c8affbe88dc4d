Durban - A bakkie load of fish that was dumped in Oaklands Drive has caused a stink in the Verulam community on Tuesday. Johnson Chetty, an eThekwini ward 106 councillor, said the fish were dumped in the area on Saturday and despite several efforts to have it removed by Durban Solid Waste and the city nothing, has happened. Hundreds of fish were dumped on the side of the road under a tree and opposite residential homes in the suburb. Prem Balram, spokesperson for Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) said a bakkie was seen driving off from the vacant property on the border of a gorge and residential houses but residents could not get all the digits on the number plate. Chetty said flies were gathering around the fish and the stench has become unbearable to the residents living in close proximity. "I have contacted the relevant eThekwini departments including the department of health. There seems to be a delayed response and passing of the buck of who should clean the mess up," Chetty said. If you have any information regarding the person or business that dumped this load of fish, please contact Reaction Unit South Africa on 0861234333. Daily News
