Cape Town - A 45-year-old paddle-skier went missing at Strandfontein in Cape Town on Sunday, the National Sea Rescue Institute said. Eyewitnesses saw the man fall out his paddle-ski and disappear under water just before 4 pm, the NSRI said. A search was launched with a sea rescue craft, jet-skis, police divers and a medical rescue helicopter hut the man has not been found. His paddle-ski was recovered.

The NSRI said the injured paraglider called Boonzaaier and when its rescue team arrived at the scene it was able to locate him as a result of the phone call to her. African News Agency (ANA)
