Philadelphia - A Pennsylvania man who barricaded himself in his home on Christmas night and shot multiple times at 11 SWAT officers surrendered nine hours later when a negotiator sang him the holiday carol "White Christmas," authorities said Thursday. Nathaniel R Lewis, 34, of East Vincent, was charged Wednesday with 11 counts of attempted murder, aggravated assault, and related crimes. Authorities said Lewis' estranged wife had asked the police to go the home for a wellness check. At 10:30 pm on December 25, the Chester County Regional Emergency Response Team arrived at Lewis' home. A negotiator used Lewis' wife's cell phone to call him and persuade him to surrender peacefully, but Lewis instead talked about "killing police and shooting up the neighbourhood," according to the affidavit of probable cause for his arrest. At 12:47 am, authorities said members of the Emergency Response Team heard several gunshots fired from a second-floor window, then a single shot from inside the house. As the sun rose at 6:05 am, authorities said Lewis sprayed bullets from the second floor, striking an armoured police vehicle. Police fired once into Lewis' home. At 6:11 am, authorities said Lewis shot at police, then again at 6:15 am. Police fired back both times, according to the affidavit of probable cause. Around 7 am, Lewis asked to hear a Christmas carol and a negotiator sang "White Christmas," authorities said. Lewis then came outside and surrendered. Inside the house, police found shell casings on the second floor, a rifle, and two magazines on the bed in the master bedroom, according to the affidavit. Lewis was taken to the Chester County Prison after he was unable to post bail. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for January 7, 2019. tca/dpa
