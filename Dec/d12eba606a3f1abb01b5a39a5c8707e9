Washington - US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will attend the state funeral in Washington for former US president George HW Bush on Wednesday. Trump will join four former US presidents and their wives for the funeral at Washington National Cathedral. Bush, the 41st US president, died at his Houston home on Friday at the age of 94. Eulogies are to be given by Bush's son, former president George W Bush, former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, former US senator Alan Simpson and presidential historian Jon Meacham, according to news reports. Trump, who harshly called fellow candidate Jeb Bush, a son of George HW Bush, "weak" and "low energy" during the 2016 presidential campaign, is not scheduled to speak, according to news reports. On Monday evening, the president and the first lady paid their respects at the US Capitol, where Bush lay in state, and on Tuesday evening they met with George W Bush, his wife Laura and other members of the Bush family. All three other living former US presidents - Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama - and their wives are scheduled to attend the funeral, according to news reports. Among the foreign leaders to attend the funeral will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who praised Bush's role in cementing German reunification during after the end of the Cold War. The funeral is scheduled to begin at 11 am (1600 GMT). The casket carrying Bush's body will be transported in a motorcade from the Capitol to the cathedral.
