CAPE TOWN - Former Chairperson of Steinhoff International, Christo Wiese reportedly said the €325m (R4.8 billion) version as up-front payments he received from the global retailer last year was legitimate. The payments relate to an arranged merger between Shoprite Holdings and Steinhoff’s operations in Africa according to Fin24. Meanwhile, Steinhoff claims that the two payments that Wiese received last year did not follow the correct procedures. It is believed that the deals agreed upon were with entities related to Wiese in the weeks before the scandal of financial irregularities hit the company. According to a statement from the company, Steinhoff said that it investigated the payments and is currently in the process of being reimbursed. In a telephonic interview, the former chairperson reportedly told Fin24 that he received two payments for shares in Steinhoff Africa Retail. The payments amount to €200m (R2.98 billion) and €125m (R1.86 billion). However, this agreement flopped and the chairperson reportedly agreed to return the cash. Wiese also cleared reports that he requested Steinhoff to cover a margin call in December 2017.
