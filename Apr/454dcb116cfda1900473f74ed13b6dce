WASHINGTON -Â Stormy Daniels, the porn star who claims to have had a consensual sexual encounter with Donald Trump a decade ago, said Tuesday that she is pursuing legal action against the president because she is "done being bullied." "I'm tired of being threatened, intimidating me, and trying to say that you'll ruin my life and take all my money and my house," Daniels said on ABC's "The View." "I'm done being bullied," Daniels said of legal threats from Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen, who is now embroiled in his own legal troubles. "I'm done," Daniels said. Cohen, Trump's long-time personal lawyer and fixer, is under criminal investigation by the FBI. Last week, agents confiscated documents in a raid on his home, hotel room, office and a safety deposit box. They also seized two cellphones. Some of the documents seized by the FBI reportedly relate to a payment of $130,000 that Cohen admits making to Daniels, who claims she had a one-night stand with Trump in July 2006 in Lake Tahoe. The president has denied any knowledge of the payment to secure Daniels's October 2016 signature on a hush agreement preventing her from talking about the liaison. Asked on "The View" about Trump's denial, Daniels said: "Let me just say I work in the adult business and I'm a better actress than he is." Daniels and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, also released a sketch of a man the adult film star said threatened her seven years ago in a parking lot, telling her to "leave Mr. Trump alone." They offered a $100,000 reward for information about the man and said they were setting up a website for tips leading to his identity. Daniels is challenging the validity of the non-disclosure agreement in court, saying Trump never signed it. Cohen has admitted to making the $130,000 payment, and has threatened Daniels with $20 million in damages for breaching the agreement. Daniels is also suing Cohen for defamation and has sought to force the president to testify under oath. AFP and AP
