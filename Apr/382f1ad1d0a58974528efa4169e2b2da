CAPE TOWN - The Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu has abandoned the investigation into the public funds that were transferred to the Black Business Council (BBC). According to reports, this comes after the Democratic Alliance (DA) probed Makwetu to investigate BBC. Allegations were made that suspended BBC president Danisa Baloyi misappropriated a R5 million donation from Airports Company SA (Acsa). The donation was reportedly meant to fund the BBCâ€™s lobbying programme. Makwetu reportedly said that he will provide space for the BBC to deal with the matter before deciding to take further action. The Auditor General said that he is waiting on the outcome of the investigation that auditing firm, SizweNtsabulaGobodo is conducting. He added that once the investigations are concluded and the outcome is available, only then will Makwetu decipher if an additional audit response is needed in the audit of the Acsa accounts, dated March 31 2018.
