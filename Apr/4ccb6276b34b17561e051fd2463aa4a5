Mogadishu - Four Ugandan peacekeeping soldiers with the African Union (AU) have been killed by Al Shabaab extremists following an attack on a base in the south of Somalia, AP reported. Sunday’s attack, which began with two suicide car bombings at the entrance to the heavily fortified Bulo-Marer base in Lower Shabelle, also left four other Ugandans injured while 22 of the attackers were killed and the rest repelled. The Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission (SRCC) for Somalia, Ambassador Francisco Caetano Madeira, on Monday lauded the AU troops in Lower Shabelle region for the gallantry they displayed, during the confrontation. The troops fought off and successfully repulsed the terrorists who had launched simultaneous attacks on Forward Operating Bases in Quoryole, Bulomareer, and Golwein.
