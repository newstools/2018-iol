Her Xhosa name is Nomzamo (“she who tries”). • Her parents, Columbo and Gertrude, were teachers. Her father taught history and her mother domestic science. • In 1953, she moved to Joburg and was admitted to the Jan Hofmeyr School of Social Work. She completed her degree in social work in 1955, finishing at the top of her class. She then took the position of medical social worker at the Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg, making her the first qualified black member of staff to fill that post. • She met lawyer Nelson Mandela in 1957 when she was 22 at a bus stop in Soweto. They married the following year and had two daughters, Zenani in 1959 and Zindziwa in 1960. • Her husband was arrested in 1963 and imprisoned from August that year to February 1990. • In June 1963 Winnie made her first visit to Nelson who was incarcerated on Robben Island. • In 1965, a new and more severe banning order was handed to Winnie that allowed her to move around only in her neighbourhood of Orlando West. • In 1969 she spent 18 months in solitary confinement at Pretoria Central Prison. • She was exiled to Brandfort in the Free State and only on occasions allowed to visit her husband on Robben Island.

She then took the position of medical social worker at the Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg, making her the first qualified black member of staff to fill that post. Two years later, in 1957, Nelson Mandela asked her for her hand in marriage and the couple wed in 1958. In October 1958, Winnie took part in a mass action which mobilised women to protest against the apartheid government’s infamous pass laws. After the arrest of her then husband, Winnie was slapped with a banning order on December 28, 1962, restricting her movements to Joburg. In June 1963 Winnie made her first visit to Nelson who was incarcerated on Robben Island. In 1965, a new and more severe banning order was handed to Winnie that allowed her to move around only in her neighbourhood of Orlando West. In May 1969 she was charged under the Terrorism Act and held in solitary confinement for 491 days, without access to a lawyer or relative. Her trial began in December 1969. In May 1973, Winnie was arrested again, for meeting with banned photographer Peter Magubane. She was handed a 12-month sentence to be served at Kroonstad women’s prison. In 1977 she was banned to the town of Brandfort in the Free State for eight years. At the end of her ban she started the Mandela United Football Club (MUFC), a group of youngsters known to be involved in vigilante attacks. The attacks included the death of 14-year-old James “Stompie” Seipei, who was accused of being an informant, in 1988. In 1990 she was at Mandela’s side when he was released after 27 years in prison. In 1992 she served as head of the ANC Women’s League, but left the position at the end of 1993. In 1996 Nelson filed for divorce from Winnie. Winnie appeared before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997, which judged her to have been implicated in a number of assaults and murders carried out by the MUFC. In 2001 she was involved in a scuffle with former president Thabo Mbeki when she arrived late for an ANC event. In 2002 she was re-elected to the ANC executive. In 2003 Winnie was convicted of fraud and theft and sentenced to five years in prison. Her conviction was later overturned. She pledged to resign all her leadership positions in the ANC. - Staff Reporter
