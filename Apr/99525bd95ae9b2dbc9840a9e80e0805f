INTERNATIONAL - Snap Inc. announced that it will be expanding its developer platform to let creators build face filters for the first time. Earlier this year, the company introduced Lens Studio, which was a platform that allowed creators to build the augmented reality objects. To add to this, Snap is releasing seven new templates into Lens Studio to allow creators build digital masks. The templates include virtual baseball hats, face paint, and tools to attach three-dimensional objects to a user’s head. In addition to the new templates, the Lens Studio is also getting Giphy integration. In February, Snapchat added the option to insert Giphy’s library of animated GIFs into snaps; now, they can feature in lenses too. In the first two months since it's launch date,over 30,000 lenses were created, which earned more than 1 billion views, according to the company. Additionally, to help promote creators’ work, Snapchat will generate a story for all public snaps created using the lens. Community lenses will be highlighted in the Discover tab, and you can unlock the lens by swiping up on the story. Snap is also announcing the Official Creator Program, which will reward top creators with extra promotion, technical support, and early access to new features and templates.
