INTERNATIONAL - Instagram is preparing to launch a new fun and interactive way that will allow you to add friends on the social platform feature. The feature is called Nametags.   Nametags will allow users to create a special image that people can scan with the Instagram Stories camera in order to follow them. Very similar to a QR code and also similar to SnapChat QR feature. No release date for the feature has been announced yet but a source at Instagram has confirmed to TechCrunch that testing is happening. Recently, the company added two new features, called focus and mention stickers. The portrait mode feature called Focus is used in the camera options. The company says Focus will be found under the record button next to the superzoom setting. “As soon as there’s someone in the shot, you’ll notice the person stays in focus while the background softly blurs,” Instagram said in the statement. “Simply tap to take a photo or tap and hold to record a video", the company said. The app also has a new way of mentioning other users in stories with a sticker. The “@mention” sticker will be found amongst the other selection of stickers. Select it, and find the user just like mentioning them in a photo caption. Instagram says Focus is available on the iPhone 6S and up and select Android devices as part of an app update.
