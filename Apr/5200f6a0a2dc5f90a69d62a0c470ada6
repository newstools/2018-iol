INTERNATIONAL - Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is shutting down his Facebook account as the social media giant struggles to cope with the worst privacy crisis in its history. In an email to USA Today, Mr Wozniak said Facebook makes a lot of advertising money from personal details provided by users. Wozniak first announced on Sunday that he's done with Facebook amid security concerns about personal information. 'I am in the process of leaving Facebook. It's brought me more negatives than positives,' Wozniak posted on the social media site on Sunday before closing his account, according to USA Today. He said the “profits are all based on the user’s info, but the users get none of the profits back”. Mr Wozniak said he would rather pay for Facebook. He said, “Apple makes money off of good products, not off of you”. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will give evidence on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and Wednesday about the company’s ongoing data privacy scandal and how it failed to guard against other abuses of its service. Facebook has announced technical changes intended to address privacy issues.
