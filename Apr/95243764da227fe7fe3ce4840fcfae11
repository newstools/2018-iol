London - Britain knows of no cases where
British residents of the so-called 'Windrush generation' from
the Caribbean have been deported due to their lack of
documentation, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said on
Tuesday. Britain on Monday apologised to thousands of the "Windrush
generation" of migrants who arrived in Britain more than 50
years ago as children and have become victims of a recent
tightening of the immigration system. Ministers gave conflicting details on Monday about whether
any of the British residents had been deported. "We have no information, we do not know of any cases where
somebody has been deported who is in this category," Lidington
told BBC radio, but added officials were checking records to
make sure nothing had "gone appallingly wrong in that way". Many of the residents have been told they need evidence
including passports to continue working or getting health
treatment despite living, working and paying tax in Britain for
decades. Some arrived on their parentsâ€™ documentation and never
formally applied for British citizenship or a passport. Reuters
