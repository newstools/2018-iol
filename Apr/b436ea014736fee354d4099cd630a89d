Dresden - Dozens of German mayors signed a joint
declaration on Friday as an act of protest against a neo-Nazi music
festival set to take place in the eastern town of Ostritz on April 20
to mark the birthday of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. "Those who question human rights and those opposed to democracy and
pluralism are not welcome here - they will not be made to feel at
home in our region," reads the declaration, which the 40 town mayors
handed over to Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer on Friday. The "Schild und Schwert Festival" (German for Shield and Sword
Festival) is being held on private property in the Saxon town of
Ostritz on April 20, with around 800 people set to attend. On its website, the festival lists a series of politicians from
right-wing extremist fringe parties, including the National
Democratic Party (NPD) and Die Rechte, as speakers at the event. Celebrations marking Hitler's birthday are common within neo-Nazi
subcultures around the world. DPA
