Head market analyst and director at Dynamic Outcomes, James Paynter, said he expected the domestic currency to push lower before climbing above R12.14. At 5pm yesterday the rand was unchanged from it’s Friday bid at the same time at R12.08 to the dollar. Against the pound, the local unit was 10c softer at R17.31 and eased 4c at R14.94 against the euro. Director and head of dealing at TreasuryOne, Wichard Cilliers said: “We need to keep an eye on the CPI number as this will give us an indication if further rate cuts will be on the cards and also if the inflation number will continue to support the currency.” He said if inflation started to pick up the rand would need to start weakening to keep the purchasing power parity.
