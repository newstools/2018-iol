CAPE TOWN - Crowd funders on a crowdfunding platform, GoFundMe raised R11 956 to buy billionaire Tesla CEO, Elon Musk a couch. This generous pledge from 72 individuals comes after Musk tweeted last week that he was sleeping on his factory Tesla's floor, reports Tech Crunch. He has been dedicating several hours to the production of the R418 540 highly-anticipated Model 3 electric car. Musk was hitting back at a recent report from The Information, which alleged Tesla's struggles to keep up with Model 3 demands. Since the report surfaced, the billionaire has taken direct control of the division in charge of producing the vehicles. In his tweet, Musk claimed he had not wrestled oversight of Model 3 production from Tesla Vice President of Engineering Doug Field, adding that changes to the company's hierarchy were an attempt to 'divide and conquer'. Musk wrote: 'My job as CEO is to focus on what’s most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. 'Doug, who I regard as one of the world’s most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering. 'About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering & production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng & prod better aligned, so we don’t design cars that are crazy hard to build. 'Right now, tho, better to divide & conquer, so I’m back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell …' Musk complained about the couch he currently has, saying that he had resorted to sleeping on the floor. The concerned public then jumped on the crowdfunding bandwagon to buy Musk a better couch. ' But one would assume that a billionaire could afford a new couch if he so desired, not so?
