Sars said the paperless system would bring an end to one of its last remaining paper-based processes and provide customs officials with the capability to track goods from beginning to end. Customs clients impacted by the new electronic reporting system include shipping lines, airlines, the national rail carrier, road hauliers, freight forwarders, port and airport authorities, terminal operators, wharf operators, transit-shed operators, licensees of depots and registered agents. This reporting requires carriers and forwarders to submit "advance loading notices" to Sars Customs within 24 hours prior to vessel departure. Teboho Mokoena, chief officer of customs and excise, said the electronic system would expedite the processing of legitimate trade and improve the management of risk for goods coming into and leaving the country.
