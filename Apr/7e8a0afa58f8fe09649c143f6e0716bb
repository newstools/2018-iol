Johannesburg - An emotional memorial service has been held in
Kenya for Sudan, the world's last male northern white rhino, who died
last month. Kenyan officials, including a local governor and a cabinet secretary
for tourism and wildlife, attended Saturday's event in honour of
Sudan and one of the rhino's caregivers gave a speech. A plaque was also unveiled to the pachyderm whose death made waves
around the world, according to a Facebook post by Ol Pejeta
Conservancy in Kenya, where Sudan had lived. "Fare thee well Sudan. You have done your work to highlight the
plight of rhino species across the world; now the onus is on us to
ensure that rhino populations thrive across our planet," the
conservancy said. READ: Conservationist shares heartbreaking message to rhino Sudan Ol Pejeta also posted pictures from the event - evidently full of
pomp and ceremony - showing staff unveiling the plaque and a framed
photograph of Sudan. The 45-year-old rhino was the last male of his species, and his death
leaves just two female northern white rhinos, his daughter Najin and
granddaughter Fatu, who also live in Ol Pejeta. All attempts at producing a male heir have failed, due toÂ Sudan's low
sperm count as well as the inability of his female mating partners to
breed. Last year, to raise money for IVF, conservationists uploaded Sudan's
profile on dating app Tinder, hoping for donations to protect "the
most eligible bachelor in the world" from extinction. After his death, Sudan's genetic material was collected, with experts
hoping to use it to reproduce northern white rhinos through advanced
cellular technologies. dpa
