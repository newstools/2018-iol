The group said the sentiment was reflected in its annual results as it posted 16percent growth in recurring headline earnings per share to 43cents a share, and achieved a 24percent return on equity for the year to end February. Chief executive Francois Gouws said the continuing positivity has pushed its key operating and financial metrics to demonstrate resilience “Given this environment, the board decided to declare a 21percent increase in the final gross dividend of 12.3c a share, up from 10.2c a share from income reserves,” Gouws said. “This brings the full year increase in the total dividend to 18percent, which for the first time in several years is more than its per share earnings growth.” PSG Konsult total income increased 11percent to R4.20billion during the period from R3.84bn, while profit increased 16percent to R566.48million from R486.86m for the year. The group said its divisions performed in line with expectations. PSG Insure reported 4percent growth in recurring headline earnings. “The 4percent growth in PSG Insure does not mean the division was poor. The Cape floods and fires in Knysna resulted in insurance claims during the period so we are happy with its performance and we don't expect to be impacted by those events in the near future,” Gouws added. PSG Insure is in an early growth phase and it achieved gross written premium growth of 15percent. “This, combined with quality underwriting practices, resulted in a net underwriting margin of 8.3percent,” he said. PSG Insure’s gross written premiums now amount to R3.30bn. PSG Asset Management recorded the best performance during the year, achieving 20percent growth in recurring headline earnings, while PSG Wealth reported 18percent growth. The group said management and other fees increased 11percent and clients’ assets managed by Wealth’s 539 advisers increased by 14percent to R163bn, which included R11.8bn of positive net inflows. PSG shares rose 0.11percent on the JSE yesterday to close at R8.77. - BUSINESS REPORT
