Vienna - Swiss police have caught a speeder who was literally
flying through the streets in the town of Koeniz, near Bern, local
police confirmed on Friday. A camera set up to catch speeding cars at a red light shot a photo of
a duck that was flapping its wings at 52 kilometres per hour in a 30
kmph zone. Soon afterwards, the trap again recorded a duck that was likewise
ignoring the local speed limit. A police officer told dpa that it was
uncertain whether it was a repeat offender or a different speeder. Meanwhile, the town authority wondered jokingly on Facebook "where
the fine for excessively fast flying should be sent?" DPA
