Detroit - Authorities say two 18-year-olds in Detroit were live on Instagram showing money and a gun when one of them shot the other in the back of the head, killing him. Police say the teen who fired the gun Monday night told investigators that he accidentally put his finger on the trigger and that the rifle discharged. He was taken into custody and the shooting remains under investigation. The victim died before paramedics arrived at the home on Detroit's northwest side. Police haven't released the names of the shooter or the victim. It's unclear how many people were watching the feed when the shooting happened. AP
