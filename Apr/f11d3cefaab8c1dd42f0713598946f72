JOHANNESBURG - The Competition Commission on Wednesday said that it has approved the proposed merger of South African grocery retailer, Pick n Pay Retailers which intends to acquire Pick n Pay Franschhoek, Pick n Pay Franschhoek Liquor and Pick n Pay Franschhoek Daily in Cape Town. Pick n Pay operates supermarkets that supply fast-moving consumer goods through wholesale and retail channels. The goods include groceries, clothing, health and beauty goods and liquor. The Franschhoek Stores form part of the Pick n Pay retail offering to consumers. As franchise stores, many products offered by the Franschhoek Stores are also offered by other Pick n Pay stores. The Commission said that it found the proposed transaction was unlikely to substantially prevent or lessen competition in any market, and that it did not raise any public interest concerns. - African News Agency (ANA)
