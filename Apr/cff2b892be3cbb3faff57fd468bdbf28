MOSCOW - The governor of Russia's
Kemerovo region resigned on Sunday over a mall fire that killed
more than 60 after a litany of violations in safety procedures
left shoppers and children trapped inside the building. Aman Tuleyev, 73, said in a video posted on the regional
administration's website that stepping down was the only course
of action possible. President Vladimir Putin accepted his
resignation, the Kremlin said. "With such a heavy burden, it's impossible to work as the
governor," said Tuleyev, who governed the region for more than
two decades. "It's morally impossible." Last Sunday's fire, one of the deadliest in Russia since the
break-up of the Soviet Union, swept through a cinema complex and
children's play area on the upper floors of the Winter Cherry
shopping centre in the regional capital. Investigators said last week that fire exits had been
illegally blocked, the public address system was not switched
on, the alarm system was broken, and children had been locked
inside cinemas. Putin said the incident had been caused by criminal
negligence and those responsible would be punished. On Sunday he appointed Sergei Tsivilyov, one of the region's
deputy governors, to replace Tuleyev as acting governor. Tsivilyov, 56, has served as the director of Kolmar, a coal
mining and processing company, for the past four years. "I want to tell you, residents of Kemerovo and all the
region, that I will do everything for those guilty in this
terrible tragedy to receive the harshest punishment," Tsivilyov
said in a video address posted on the regional administration's
website. On Friday, police arrested an executive with the firm that
owns the shopping mall. The calamitous way the emergency was handled stirred public
anger in Kemerovo and focused attention on corruption and lax
fire safety standards. Rallies commemorating the victims were
held across the country, including in Moscow and St Petersburg. Reuters
