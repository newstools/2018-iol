Washington - The left-leaning opposition Democratic Party filed
a lawsuit Friday alleging that Donald Trump's presidential campaign
conspired with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election. The suit filed in federal court in New York accuses the Trump
campaign of working with Russian intelligence and the Wikileaks
organization - also named as a defendant - to hack the Democratic
National Committee (DNC) and damage the party's presidential nominee,
Hillary Clinton. The lawsuit comes amid an investigation led by Justice Department
special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian election meddling,
including ties to Trump's presidential bid. DNCÂ Chairman Tom Perez said that Moscow waged "an all-out assault on
our democracy, and it found a willing and active partner in Donald
Trump's campaign." ALSO READ: Russia did not meddle in US vote, Putin tells Trump Perez said that the relationship "constituted an act of unprecedented
treachery: the campaign of a nominee for President of the United
States in league with a hostile foreign power to bolster its own
chance to win the presidency." There was no immediate response from the White House. Trump late Thursday tweeted that there was "NO COLLUSION and NO
OBSTRUCTION" as he repeated his claim that the Mueller probe is a
"witch hunt." The Democratic Party lawsuit seeks millions of dollars in damages. DPA
