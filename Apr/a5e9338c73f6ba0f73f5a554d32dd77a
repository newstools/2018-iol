Geneva - The World Health Organisation
condemned a suspected chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria
last weekend, in which it said an estimated 500 patients went to
health facilities with "signs and symptoms consistent with
exposure to toxic chemicals". "WHO demands immediate unhindered access to the area to
provide care to those affected, to assess the health impacts,
and to deliver a comprehensive public health response," Peter
Salama, WHO deputy director-general for emergency preparedness
and response, said in a statement issued in Geneva. UN aid agencies do not have access to most of the enclave
of eastern Ghouta, including Douma, where the alleged attack
occurred. The Syrian government has denied responsibility. READ MORE: Cocktail of poisons may have been used to kill dozens in Syria's Douma Expert team to probe Syrian sarin gas attack The need to expose chemical attacks in Syria Both sides guilty in chemical weapons nightmare Reuters
