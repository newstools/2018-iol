Port Elizabeth - A suspected gang kingpin, along with four other men, appeared in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Monday in connection with a triple murder. There was heightened security and Bird Street was blocked off by police and metro police members, while the building was lined with members from the police's Tactical Response Team (TRT) for the appearance of alleged gang boss Wendell Petersen and his co-accused. Members of the public were searched several times before being allowed to enter the court room. Petersen, Jermaine Mitchell, Glynn Carelson, Robin Taylor and Graham Kammies were all in court on Monday, but charges against Morne Nel for involvement in the murders have since been withdrawn, said State Advocate Mujaahid Sandan.

Petersen has since requested to be moved from Kirkwood Prison to St Albans Prison. Petersen's lawyer Deon Erasmus has also brought an application to obtain documentation which enabled the State to intercept his client's phone calls. The State has opposed the application.
