Bhubaneswar, India - India's state-run
railway has suspended seven workers after brakes failed on a
22-coach train carrying hundreds of passengers, letting it run
freely in reverse for about 13 km (eight miles), officials said
on Monday. The train, en route from Ahmedabad in the western Indian
state of Gujarat to Puri in Odisha state in the east, rolled
downhill for about 45 minutes on Saturday before gradually
slowing to a halt, the latest in a series of accidents involving
the world's fourth-largest rail network. It was not immediately clear what speed the runaway train
reached but no casualties or injuries were reported. Iron tools used to stop trains were not properly put in
place, according to a senior railways official.   "By the time the train had rolled down to the nearest
station, it had slowed down drastically and it was brought to a
halt with the help of wooden wedges," the official said, adding
that passengers also helped stop the train. Indian Railways employs 1.3 million people and is filling
tens of thousands of vacant positions for engine drivers,
technicians, carpenters, track inspection crews and other roles
related to improving safety in the world's fourth-largest
network. Investigations were under way. Reuters
