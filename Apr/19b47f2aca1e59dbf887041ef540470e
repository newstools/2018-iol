Johannesburg - SACP leader Blade Nzimande says Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s death should be used to deepen the effort to strengthen the alliance. Nzimande said Madikizela-Mandela was a symbol of strength and defiance and her loss was not just for her family, but also for the nation. “Maybe we need to turn this lose into something constructive for ourselves, maybe we should say in her name that we deepen our effort to strengthen the alliance and unite the ANC,” he said. “We should use her as a symbol of the unity of the alliance.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
