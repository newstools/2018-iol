London - Yulia Skripal has been
discharged from a British hospital, the BBC reported on Tuesday,
just over a month after being poisoned with a nerve agent along
with her father Sergei, a former Russian double agent. The Skripals were found unconscious on a bench on March 4 in
the southern English city of Salisbury and they were in a
critical condition for weeks until their health began to improve
rapidly. Britain says they were poisoned with a military-grade nerve
agent and has blamed Russia for the attack. Moscow has denied
any involvement in the incident which has plunged its relations
with the West to a post-Cold War low. Yulia, who Russia's RIA news agency had reported was seeking
political asylum in Britain, was taken to a secure location
after being discharged from hospital late on Monday, the BBC
said. On Friday, doctors said both Yulia, 33, and her 66-year-old
father had got much better and last week Yulia Skripal issued a
statement to say her strength was growing daily. A spokesman for the hospital declined to comment. Reuters
