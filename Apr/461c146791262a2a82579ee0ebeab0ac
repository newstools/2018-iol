CAPE TOWN - Advancements in smartphone camera technology have partially led to the arrest of a drug dealer, based on a WhatsApp photograph of the dealer’s hand, reports The Verge. This comes after a WhatsApp message doing its rounds in South Wales, Britain came into the hands of police. Although the image offers a glimpse of a small part of the dealer’s fingerprints, forensic scientists were able to confirm the identity of the suspect, and an arrest was made. This provides a great example of how technological advancements, especially in the mobile industry, has led to tangible results in other different aspects of life, namely security. On Tuesday, Science and Technology Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi- Ngubane said he will help send off Africa’s largest and most advanced cube satellite this week. The 4kg ZACube-2 has been developed by the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) and the French South African Institute of Technology (F’Sati) and is the second nanosatellite to be developed at the university. ZACube-2 is a triple unit CubeSat - three times the size of its predecessor - which was called TshepisoSat. ZACube-2 was developed by F’Sati’s Satellite Programme and will be launched into space later this year. F’Sati director Prof Robert van Zyl said ZACube-2 would now be shipped to The Netherlands where it would be integrated with other CubeSats. It would make its way to India where it would be launched.
