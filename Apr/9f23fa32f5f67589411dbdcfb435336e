MOSCOW - Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad told a group of Russian lawmakers on Sunday that
Western missile strikes on his country were an act of
aggression, Russian news agencies reported. The Russian lawmakers met with Assad after the United
States, France and Britain launched missile strikes on Syria in
retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack a week ago. Russia, which is helping Assad fight rebel forces opposed to
his rule, immediately condemned the strikes and called for an
emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. "From the point of view of the president, this was
aggression and we share this position," Russia's TASS news
agency quoted lawmaker Sergei Zheleznyak as saying after the
meeting with Assad. The Syrian president was in a "good mood" and continuing his
work in Damascus, agencies cited the lawmakers as saying, and
praised the Soviet-era air defence systems used by Syria to help
to repel the Western attacks. A senior Russian military official said on Saturday that
Syria's air defences, which mostly consist of systems made in
the Soviet Union, had intercepted 71 of the 105 American,
British and French missiles. The Pentagon has said the strikes successfully hit the
three chemical weapons facilities which were targeted. "Yesterday we saw American aggression. And we were able to
repel it with Soviet missiles from the 70s," Russian lawmaker
Dmitry Sablin quoted Assad as saying, TASS reported. Sablin also said Assad accepted an invitation to visit the
Siberian region of Khanty-Mansi in Russia. It was not clear when
the visit would take place. Russia said on Saturday it would consider supplying S-300
surface to-air missile systems to Syria following the Western
strikes, but this was not discussed at the meeting with Assad,
agencies reported. Assad also declined to comment on calls by the U.S. State
Department to declare alleged Syrian stockpiles of chemical
weapons, Zheleznyak said. Reuters
