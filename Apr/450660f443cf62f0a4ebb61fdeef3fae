CAPE TOWN - The Black Business Council (BBC) has welcomed the resignation of Mark Lamberti as CEO of Imperial and board member of Eskom and Business Leadership South Africa. On Thursday the BBC said that they would like to acknowledge and thank the companies for taking a firm position against sexism and racism. The organisation believes that these companies have demonstrated that they could not habour a racist and sexist in their mist. The BBC further called for harsh action to be taken against Thulani Gcabashe, former chairperson of the Imperial board, by all companies and institutions where he serves. 4 Gcabashe has been critisised by the BBC for siding with Lamberti, who harassed Adila Chowan. "Chowan turned to Gcabashe twice for help. She wrote two letters to Gcabashe pointing out unacceptable behaviour by Imperial CEO Lamberti and another executive, Janse van Rensburg. Gcabashe did not only dismiss her charges but subjected her to a disciplinary process for raising the grievance in a behaviour characterised by the judge as somewhat irrational. And she was subsequently suspended by the company for raising the grievance", the statement said. “The BBC is disappointed with Gcabashe as we expected him to be a progressive agent of change in companies, as he experienced discrimination first hand in his illustrious career, instead of being a keen defender of the old order,” says Kganki Matabane, the CEO of the BBC.
