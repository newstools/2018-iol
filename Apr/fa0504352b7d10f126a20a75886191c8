Tshwane - South Africa’s attainment of full democracy in 1994 would not have been possible without the unstinting support and solidarity of the international community, which made enormous sacrifices, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Saturday. “Our freedom owes a great deal to the devout support of the international community. Many countries offered solidarity and opened their arms to our activists. Many people in our neighbouring countries lost life and limb for our cause,” Ramaphosa said at the annual national awards ceremony in Pretoria. “It is therefore a special honour today [Saturday] to confer the Order of the Companions of Oliver Tambo in gold to four former heads of state - excellencies Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, Sam Nujoma of Namibia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, and the late Sir Ketumile Masire of Botswana.” Ramaphosa said Pretoria would want to pay tribute to other nations around the world who also stood with the South African people during the brutal fight against apartheid, providing shelter and material. “We also honour those remarkable human beings who stood alongside our people, at home and in exile, who provided material and other assistance to our students, activists, and combatants. In doing so, we express our sincere and eternal gratitude to them for joining a struggle that was not theirs, in a land far from their own, and for giving so much, for so long, to so many,” said Ramaphosa. "Allow me to mention in particular ambassador Alexander Sergeevich Dsasokhov and Dr Slava Tetekin of Russia and Ms Rosita Johnson of the United States, whom we honour today. We wish to congratulate all those who are to be honoured today,” he said. The national orders are annually bestowed on distinguished South African citizens and eminent foreign nationals who have played a momentous role towards building a free and peaceful democratic South Africa and improving the lives of humanity in various ways. The awards bestowed on Saturday were in the categories of the Order of Ikhamanga, the Order of the Baobab, the Order of Luthuli, and the Order of the Companions of OR Tambo. Ramaphosa, working with Chancellor of the national orders director general in the presidency Cassius Lubisi, bestowed the prestigious awards on 40 recipients, which included sports stars, political activists and former presidents, musicians, judicial officers, and artists. A jovial former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke walked away with South Africa’s highest honour - the Order of Luthuli in gold - for his "exceptional contribution to the field of law and the administration of justice in democratic South Africa”. The full list of recipients as provided by the presidency is: The Order of Ikhamanga recognises South African citizens who have excelled in the fields of arts, culture, literature, music, journalism, and sport:         Order of the Baobab recognises South African citizens who have contributed to community service, business and economy, science, medicine, and technological innovation:   The Order of Luthuli recognises South African citizens who have contributed to the struggle for democracy, nation-building, building democracy and human rights, justice and peace, as well as for the resolution of conflict:   The Order of the Companions of OR Tambo recognises eminent foreign nationals for friendship shown to South Africa. It is therefore an order of peace, co-peration and active expression of solidarity and support:   African News Agency/ANA
