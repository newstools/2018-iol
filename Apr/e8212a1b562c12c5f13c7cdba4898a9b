Vatican City - For Christians, helping the poor should be as
much of a priority as fighting against abortion, Pope Francis said in
a new papal document released Monday. The Gaudete and Exsultate (Rejoice and be Glad) Apostolic Exhortation
is a 44-page guide book from the leader of the world's 1.3 billion
Catholics on how to be holy in the modern world. "Our defence of the innocent unborn, for example, needs to be clear,
firm and passionate, for at stake is the dignity of a human life,
which is always sacred," Francis said. "Equally sacred, however, are the lives of the poor, those already
born, the destitute, the abandoned and the underprivileged, the
vulnerable infirm and elderly exposed to covert euthanasia, the
victims of human trafficking, new forms of slavery, and every form of
rejection," he added.   Pope Francis said it was not permissible to see the plight of
migrants as a "lesser issue" than "grave bioethical questions" such
as the battle against euthanasia or abortion. Francis is under fire from conservatives for focusing more on
outreach efforts towards sinners and non-believers than on the
enforcement of Catholic doctrine. Worshipping, praying and "following certain ethical norms" is not
enough to be a good Christian, because "the ultimate criterion on
which our lives will be judged is what we have done for others," he
warned. Francis' last Apostolic Exhortation, 2016's Amoris Laetitia, included
a softening of a long-standing ban on Communion for remarried
divorcees that is still deeply controversial within the Catholic
world. dpa
