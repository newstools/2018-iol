Algiers - More than 250 people including
members of Western Sahara’s Polisario independence movement were
killed when a military plane crashed in a field outside
Algeria’s capital on Wednesday, officials said. Television footage showed crowds gathering around the
smoking and flaming wreckage near Boufarik airport southwest of
Algiers. A line of white body bags could be seen on the ground
next to what media said was a Russian Ilyushin transport plane. A total of 257 people died in the crash, state TV reported. A member of Algeria’s ruling FLN party told the private
Ennahar TV station the dead included 26 members of Polisario, an
Algerian-backed group fighting for the independence of
neighbouring Western Sahara – a territory also claimed by
Morocco in a long-running dispute. The plane was heading to Tindouf, an area on Algeria’s
border with Western Sahara, but crashed on the airport’s
perimeter, Algeria’s defence ministry said. WATCH: Scores feared dead after military plane crashes near Algiers Tindouf is home to thousands of refugees from the Western
Sahara standoff, many of them Polisario supporters. UN attempts to broker a settlement have failed for years
in the vast desert area, which has contested since 1975 when
Spanish colonial powers left. Morocco claimed the territory
while Polisario established its self-declared Sahrawi Arab
Democratic Republic there. Algeria’s defence ministry issued a statement expressing
condolences to families of the victims. In February 2014, an Algerian Air Force Lockheed C-130
Hercules crashed in a mountainous area in eastern Algeria
killing 77 passengers and leaving one survivor. Reuters
