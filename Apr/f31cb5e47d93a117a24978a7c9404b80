BERLIN - Former Catalan President Carles
Puigdemont called on Spain to abandon its attempts to prosecute
separatist leaders as he left a German prison on Friday, urging
Madrid to enter into dialogue with them. Puigdemont, granted bail after German judges ruled he could
not be extradited on charges of "rebellion" brought by Spain,
thanked prison staff as he emerged to cheers and people waving
Catalan flags. He called for "the immediate release of all my colleagues in
Spanish prisons". "It is a shame for Europe to have political prisoners,"
Puigdemont said. "Finally the time for dialogue has arrived." Judges on Thursday rejected Spain's request to have him
extradited to face the rebellion charges for having organised a
referendum on Catalan independence that Madrid viewed as
illegitimate. They set bail at 75,000 euros ($92,000), saying that
Puigdemont, who fled Spain five months ago after Spanish Prime
Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed his regional administration,
did not pose a serious flight risk. Puigdemont's German lawyer, Wolfgang Schomburg, said he
would continue the legal battle to have judges also rule out his
extradition on a lesser charge of embezzlement of public money. Since Spain has said it will respect the German court's
ruling, extradition from Germany on the lesser charge would
effectively grant Puigdemont immunity from the rebellion
charges, which can bring up to 25 years in prison. But a return to Spain under any other circumstances might
not do so. Earlier, the German foreign ministry urged Catalan lawmakers
to form a new regional government as soon as possible, saying
this was a precondition for making progress on a political
settlement to the stand-off with Madrid. Reuters
