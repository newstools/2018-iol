LONDON - Britain's Prime Minister
Theresa May is under pressure to introduce legislation
guaranteeing promises made to long-term residents from the
Caribbean who have being incorrectly labelled illegal
immigrants. For almost two weeks, British ministers have been struggling
to explain why some descendants of the so-called "Windrush
generation", invited to Britain to plug labour shortfalls
between 1948 and 1971, are being denied basic rights because of
trouble documenting their status. The Windrush scandal overshadowed the Commonwealth summit in
London earlier this month and has raised questions about May's
six-year stint as interior minister before she became prime
minister in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum. The government has apologised for the fiasco, promised
citizenship and compensation to those affected, including to
people who have lost their jobs, been threatened with
deportation and denied benefits because of the errors. But more than 200 mainly opposition members of parliament
have written to the prime minister calling for the pledges to be
written into law "without delay". The letter accuses the interior minister Amber Rudd, who has
faced calls to resign over her handling of the scandal, of
making up policy "on the hoof" to defuse the situation. Rudd is due to address parliament on Monday after giving
contradictory statements about whether the government has
immigration removal targets. In a separate letter, the shadow interior minister Diane
Abbott has called for a full inquiry into whether the interior
minister misled parliament and breached the ministerial code. Abbott said Rudd's explanations as to why she had told
members of parliament there were no such targets, when in fact
there were, "stretch credulity to the limit". But May's office said there is no need for an investigation
because ministerial code only requires a resignation if a
minister knowingly misleads parliament - a charge the interior
minister denies. Reuters
