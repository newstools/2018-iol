Johannesburg - The ANC on Sunday sent its condolences to the families of Akhumzi Jezile, Siyasanga Kobese and Thobani Mseleni following their deaths in a car accident. Jezile, Kobese and Mseleni died in a car crash on the N6 near Queenstown, Eastern Cape, as they were driving to a family funeral. The accident claimed the lives of two other people. The ANC in a statement said it was saddened to learn of the passing of the trio. "Jezile started out as a young TV presenter where he honed his skills and grew to become a producer and director of some of the country’s most popular TV shows. Kobese, was widely known as the lead singer for popular group Joyous Celebration, but had displayed further talent as an actor in local production “Zabalaza”. "Mseleni was an actor whose most recent notable work was a role in the award winning movie "Inxeba: The Wound”.     Sometimes you just have to allow them to speak about you, they always think you don't know about the things they say about you but it's ok. Keep your head high and keep walking. #Move #success #strength #actorslife #businessman #Mselenisays A post shared by  thobani mseleni (@thobanimseleni) on Apr 25, 2018 at 2:40am PDT ALSO READ: #RIPAkhumzi: Friends, colleagues mourn death of Akhumzi Jezile The party added that: "The ANC sends its condolences to the families of the victims, their friends, colleagues and fans whose lives they have touched in many ways.
