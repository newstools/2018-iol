Bangui - Hundreds of angry demonstrators
on Wednesday laid the bodies of at least nine people killed in
clashes in Central African Republic's capital Bangui in front of
the headquarters of the United Nation's mission, a Reuters
witness said. The demonstration coincides with a visit to the country,
which has been mired in a cycle of ethnic and religious violence
since 2013, by Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the UN's head of
peacekeeping operations. The peacekeeping mission, MINUSCA, said late on Tuesday that
one Rwandan UN soldier was killed and eight were wounded in
clashes with armed groups in the PK5 neighbourhood, a Muslim
area of the majority Christian city. MINUSCA and local security forces launched an operation in
PK5 on Sunday aimed at dismantling the bases of armed groups the
U.N. said were responsible for extortion and attacks on
civilians. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), which
operates one of the main hospitals in Bangui, said it had
treated more than 40 people for gunshot wounds on Tuesday. Reuters
