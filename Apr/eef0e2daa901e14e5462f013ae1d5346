Tel Aviv - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday, after Erdogan
called the killing of at least 15 Palestinians along the Israel-Gaza
border a "massacre." "The most moral army in the world will not be preached to by those
who for years indiscriminately bombed civilian populations,"
Netanyahu said on Twitter. On Friday, at least 15 Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops
during protests in the Gaza Strip. Israel says it was responding to
Palestinian rioting along the Israel-Gaza border, as tens of
thousands of Palestinians marched in the name of Palestinian refugees
who fled or were expelled from their homes in present-day Israel. International human rights groups criticized Israel's use of live
ammunition on the protesters, while UN Secretary General Antonio
Guterres has called for an inquiry into the deaths. Erdogan, a vocal supporter of Palestinians, condemned on Saturday
what he described as a "massacre" carried out by Israel in the Gaza
Strip this week. "We will continue to exposeÂ Israeli terror all the time and on all
platforms," Erdogan told supporters in Istanbul, describing Friday's
events as an "inhumane attack." Israel and Turkey re-established diplomatic relations in 2016 after a
six-year freeze. DPA
