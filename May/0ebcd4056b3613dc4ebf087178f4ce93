A 56-year-old man has been in custody since Thursday after he was charged with the attempted murder of one of his colleagues.

Police said on Tuesday that the focus of their investigation was on two cases of illness and that they have not ruled out further cases. No indication was given of the symptoms. According to unconfirmed reports in the German tabloid press, one of the employees has been in a coma with mercury poisoning.
