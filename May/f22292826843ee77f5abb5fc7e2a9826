This impacted Telkom’s performance, particularly in BCX, which serves the business sectors.” He said that the growth in the mobile business was underpinned by capital investment, extension of distribution channels, increased store footprint and innovative data-led products which resonated well with customers. Telkom, in which the government plans to sell part of its 39 percent stake, is also grappling with an economy that is barely growing and intense competition amid political and policy uncertainty and sovereign credit rating downgrades in 2017. “Our focus going forward is to increase the contribution from the new generation revenue streams (mobile and data),” he said. “Despite their lower margin compared to traditional revenue streams, the new-generation revenue streams will ensure Telkom’s long-term sustainability.” Telkom declared an annual dividend of 355 cents per share, down 16.3%.
