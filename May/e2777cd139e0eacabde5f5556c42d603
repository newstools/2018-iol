Sullivan said a shareholder roadshow was undertaken in May last year to seek feedback from its major shareholders on its remuneration policy. “We welcomed their comments and input. An approval rating for our remuneration policy of 95.9% was received at the group’s annual general meeting in May 2017. “The group ensures that remuneration is responsible and fair, including that it is funded by, and linked to, the creation of value over the long term; the requirement that remuneration decisions are rational and objective, impartial, free from discrimination, free from self-interest, favouritism or prejudice on grounds, including race, gender and sexual orientation; and the requirement that stakeholder views are taken into account.” Other banks’ chief executives were paid handsomely during the period. Capitec Bank’s chief executive Gerrie Fourie was leader with a total remuneration R56.6m. Absa bank chief executive Maria Ramos received R37m, while Nedbank’s Mike Brown was paid R38m during the year.
