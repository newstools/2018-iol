Paris -Â The young Malian migrant who saved a four-year-old child hanging from a fourth-floor Paris balcony after scaling the facade with his bare hands will be made a French citizen, President Emmanuel Macron said Monday. Mamoudou Gassama, who met with Macron on Monday at the presidential Elysee Palace after a video of his rescue went viral on social media, will also be offered a place in the fire brigade, the president added. The 22-year-old migrant from Mali is being honoured by Macron for scaling an apartment building over the weekend to save a 4-year-old child dangling from a fourth-floor balcony. Gassama quickly scaled a building in Paris' northern 18th district on Saturday, climbing from balcony to balcony until reaching the fourth floor, to grab the child clinging for life and whisk it to safety.
