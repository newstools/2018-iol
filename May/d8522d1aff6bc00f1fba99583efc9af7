Cape Town - Convicted murderer Henri van Breda will spend his first night in jail after he was convicted on three counts of premeditated murder, one of attempted murder and defeating the ends of justice in the Western Cape High Court on Monday. Judge Siraj Desai revoked his bail but agreed that Van Breda could be held in the hospital section of Pollsmoor prison. He told defence lawyer Piet Botha that correctional services must be provided with medical certificates to justify that decision. Botha had argued that his client is on anti-depressants and chronic medication for epilepsy. Van Breda, 23, attacked his family members, killing his parents and brother, in the early hours of January 27, 2015. He was also convicted of the attempted murder of his sister Marli, who was 16 at the time and suffered retrograde amnesia, rendering her unable to testify in the trial. #VanBreda: Judge says there was no evidence of breach Van Breda was also convicted of defeating the ends of justice for tampering with the crime scene, giving police false information and self-inflicting injuries to appear like a victim himself. The attacks happened in the early hours of the morning of January 27, 2015, at the Van Breda family home in the centre of a Stellenbosch security estate, De Zalze.
