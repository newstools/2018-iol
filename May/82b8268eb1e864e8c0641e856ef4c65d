Port Elizabeth - African National Congress (ANC) councillor Andile Lungisa was granted bail of R10 000 in the Port Elizabeth Regional Court on Friday. This is pending a petition to the Grahamstown High Court after leave to appeal Lungisa’s conviction and two-year sentence for assault was dismissed by Magistrate Mornay Cannon last month. Lungisa was found guilty of intentionally smashing a glass jug over the head of former mayoral committee member for transport, Rano Kayser, during a chaotic 2016 Nelson Mandela Bay council meeting.
