INTERNATIONAL - A security researcher, Chief Hacking Officer of company KnowBe4 Kevin Mitnick has developed a social engineering attack to breach two-factor authentication, TechCrunch reported. In a public video, Mitnick produced a video on YouTube showing how the exploit works by sending victims to a fake login page. The site requests your username, password, and authentication code, which it passes to the legitimate site to log you in, while capturing the session cookie in the process. This is known as a phishing attack. What is a phishing attack? Phishing is the attempt of a hacker to obtain sensitive and personal information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, often for malicious reasons. Once this is done, the hacker can log in whenever they want, according to the report. While the attack was demonstrated on LinkedIn, Mitnick’s company KnowBe4 warned that the attack could be weaponised for any site. Additionally, Stu Sjouwerman, CEO of KnowBe4 told TechCrunch that anti-phishing education is deeply important and that a hack like this is impossible to complete if the victim is savvy about security and the dangers of clicking links that come into your email box.

It is worth noting that the video was first posted on Facebook 11 months ago, and yet there seem to be no security measures implemented by WhatsApp to prevent or notify this relatively easy hacking process.
