CAPE TOWN - Swahili has become the first African language to receive language recognition from Twitter. Previously, Twitter has referred to Swahili words as Indonesian in terms of translation. However, now the platform has started recognising Swahili words and offers a translation of the widely spoken and written East and Southern African language. Records indicate that the language is spoken by 50 million plus people especially in East Africa. Swahili is listed as a national language for the following countries: Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda. Swahili is however yet to be added in the language settings of Twitter. Since last week, Twitter started detecting the language in tweets and subsequently offered a close to perfect translation as with most other foreign languages. On Twitter, the trends  #SwahiliIsNotIndonesian and #TwitterRecognizeSwahili were trending.
