Berlin â€” Austrian authorities say a 63-year-old Vienna man is suspected of killing and dismembering a woman and stashing pieces in his freezer to later eat. Prosecutor Verena Strnad told reporters Wednesday the suspect, whose name wasn't released, confessed to authorities he killed the unidentified woman in his apartment at the end of March and cut her into pieces. The woman's torso, head and other parts were discovered mid-April in the Neusiedler See, a lake southeast of Vienna where the suspect had a cabin and boat. Austria's APA news agency reported police dogs found DNA traces near the cabin. The body parts in the freezer were found during the ensuing search of his apartment. Associated Press
