Cape Town - Hours after her reinstatement as City of Cape Town mayor and DA councillor, Patricia de Lille revealed she was already back at work. The Western Cape High Court earlier ruled that De Lille be reinstated as mayor and councillor pending a reviewing court's ruling on May 25. Judge Patrick Gamble said that De Lille, now that she has been reinstated to her position as mayor, must subject herself to the party's disciplinary processes. She faces misconduct charges. Gamble also emphasised the court's concern for Cape Town's citizens and said there needed to be stability in the DA leadership.

The rule was used to oust De Lille as mayor and from the party after she said in an interview with Eusebius McKaiser on 702 Radio that she would resign from the country's second biggest party as soon as she had cleared her name in a bitter dispute with its leadership.
