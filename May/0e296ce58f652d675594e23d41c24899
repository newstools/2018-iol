Johannesburg - A court case against an Ekurhuleni farmer who allegedly forced his worker to eat faeces and then
tried to drown him in a septic tank was postponed in the Springs Magistrates' court on Monday. Harry Leicester, as well as his wife and son, face possible charges
of kidnapping and attempted murder, according to the South African
Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), the body that brought the case to the Equality court. "On December 9, 2017, the family allegedly forced an employee to
drink litres of faecal matter before attempting to drown him in a
septic tank on their farm," the SAHRC said in a statement. "It is alleged that the farm in question has been the site of
continuous human rights violations," the statement added. READ MORE: 'Farmer forced me to drink litres of faeces' Disturbing testimony was heard in court on Monday, with SAHRC
attorney Buang Jones tweeting that the farm worker, Joseph Mona, was
repeatedly called racial slurs by his employer.      "The farmer took a big jug, dipped it in the sewer hole and forced
the Complainant to drink its contents," he said. The farmer and his
son then dragged Mona to a sewer hole.      "Right to human dignity (and dignified existence) is not a practical
reality for many farmer workers and dwellers in South Africa," Jones
tweeted. The case was postponed to May 29.      Twenty-four years after the end of apartheid, racism persists in
South Africa, with multiple abuse cases shocking residents of the
"Rainbow Nation." Last year, two white South African farmers, Theo Jackson and Willem
Oosthuizen, got 14 and 11 years in jail, respectively, after they
forced a black man into a coffin and threatened to set it alight. DPA and IOL
