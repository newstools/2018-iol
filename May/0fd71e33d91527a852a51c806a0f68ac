CAPE TOWN - Cell C has announced that subscribers using its black streaming service won’t incur data costs while streaming until August 2018. What is black? black is a streaming service that allows users to stream movies, series, and sport. The service first launched on 14 November 2017, by bringing consumers a full 360-entertainment experience from video-on-demand through to live TV streaming. The service hopes to cater for both the local market and for those viewers who enjoy international content, according to Cell C It also includes live streaming of five top European football club channels, and services like sports betting and hotel bookings. The service offers a seven-day free trial and subscriptions start at R5 per day. “We know the biggest hurdle to gaining access to streaming content is the data component, and so for the next three months, any existing or new black customer that is also on the Cell C network will not have to even consider having data to be able to download or stream their favourite shows,” Cell C chief executive officer Jose Dos Santos said in a statement. Customers won’t need a minimum balance to have their black data zero-rated and the offer extends to both existing and new black subscribers, added Dos Santos. “We are very excited to have partnered with Cell C on this initiative. We understand that one of the biggest barriers to content consumption is the cost of data. We believe that this is one step to start alleviating the cost of data for black customers on the Cell C network,” black chief executive Surie Ramasary said. Subscribers can stream Jumanji, Star War: The Last Jedi and more right now, and Black Panther will be coming to the service in June.
