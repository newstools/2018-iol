Bogota - Paraguay will move its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem
from Tel Aviv, the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. The decision, which had already been announced by Israel, was taken
by President Horacio Cartes. The ministry "has started the process of putting the presidential
decision into effect, and given the corresponding instructions to the
diplomatic representation of Paraguay in Israel," according to the statement. The South American country is the third to announce a move to the
contested city, after the United States and Guatemala. The US decision in December rocked the Middle East when it was announced by
President Donald Trump. ALSO READ: Trump says he'll move US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem Preparations are currently underway for the US embassy's move from
