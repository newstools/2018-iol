The rand weakened to R12.70 against the greenback at 5 pm, compared to R12.64 on Tuesday. The local currency was bid at R12.27 against the pound, compared to R17.18 in the previous session, while it weakened to R15.19 against the euro, compared to R15.16. Senior currency dealer at TreasuryONE, Andre Botha, said the rand could be in for a volatile ride in the long term. “The recent US dollar strength is due to the market front-running more hawkish Fed due to inflation looking to surprise to the top side,” Botha said. “We have seen US Treasury yields spiking to 9-year highs in anticipation of the more hawkish stance that the Fed is expected to take.” The all-share index closed up 0.37% at 58466 points, while the benchmark Top40 index was up 0.29% at 51570 points.
