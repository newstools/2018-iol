Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia's newly appointed transport minister said on Wednesday the private US based Ocean Infinity's search for the missing plane MH370 will end next week. Anthony Loke said the search was due to end in April but was extended twice following requests from Ocean Infinity until May 29.
