JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa's government has taken control of the North West, the first time the national government has taken over an entire provincial administration, the Sunday Times reported. At the same time, two-thirds of the province’s municipalities were being taken over by the co-operative governance and traditional affairs department, the newspaper reported. "The moves are a dramatic intervention by Ramaphosa against North West premier Supra Mahumapelo, who reneged on a public undertaking to step down this week and instead took a leave of absence without presidential approval," it said.
