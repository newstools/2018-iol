CAPE TOWN -  Volvo Group Southern Africa said it was planning to invest more than R20 million on apprenticeship training, automotive industry learnerships, disabled person learnerships, as well as internships in 2018. President of Volvo Group Southern Africa, Torbjörn Christensson, said that since 2015, the group has invested more than R86 million on apprenticeship training, automotive industry learnerships, disabled person learnerships, as well as internships. “The company is planning to invest another R25 million during 2018. During the course of 2018, Volvo Group will also establish a specialised Driver Training Academy to address the shortage of skilled drivers in the region, an investment of R1.4 million.” Christensson said this during President Ramaphosa’s tour at the Volvo Trucks assembly plant in Durban on Saturday. “We are also continuing our involvement in Star for Life, a non-profit organisation that aims to provide young people in South Africa with essential life skills, sport training, and health education.  Just in the three years from 2017 to 2019, we are planning to invest around R7.8 million in this very worthy cause,” said Christensson. Also in attendance was the minister of economic development, Ebrahim Patel, minister of higher education, Naledi Pandor, as well as the deputy minister of trade and industry, Bulelani Gratitude Magwanishe. During his address, president Ramaphosa thanked Volvo for its continuing investment in the South African economy and its commitment in particular to the empowerment and development of the country’s youth. “Volvo is one of those companies who believe that it is not enough to invest in factories, machinery, and supply chains,” said President Ramaphosa.  “They believe it is necessary also to invest in society. We, therefore, applaud Volvo for making youth development such an integral part of its social investment programme.” - African News Agency (ANA)
