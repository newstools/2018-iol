Philadelphia - Lawyers for a 37-year-old Mexican man who was taken into custody during a mandatory marriage interview at immigration offices in Philadelphia say his detention is unlawful. Jose "Ivan" Noe Nunez Martinez and his U.S.-citizen husband Paul Frame visited U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on January 31 to petition for Nu√±ez Martinez to gain legal status. Instead, ICE officers arrested Nunez Martinez, who had a previous order of removal. Nunez Martinez remains at York County Prison, even though his attorneys and advocates say he passed his marriage interview and a credible fear interview for asylum. Attorneys have filed a habeas corpus petition claiming that Nunez Martinez has a right to a bond hearing to prove he would not be a security threat if released. A message from The Associated Press seeking comment from ICE wasn't immediately returned Tuesday. AP
