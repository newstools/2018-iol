CAPE TOWN - Minister of Social Development, Susan Mashangu along with new acting CEO of Sassa, Abraham Mahlangu today launched the new Sassa card in Worcester. The launch of the new card is a pilot project which will reportedly be launched at nine sites around the country. Lindiwe Kwele, chief operations officer at the Post Office said in April that the new card will come with benefits and there would be “no funny deductions”. “The only deductions allowed will be those for funeral policies. The deductions would not exceed 10%,” said Kwele. The Minister explained how the card works at the launch in Worcester. According to Mashangu, every Sassa beneficiary will require the new Sassa card. The minister said that card swaps can be done at Sassa offices. Later on, the South African Post Office will also make provision for card swaps, added Mahlangu. The Post Office will also allow for card swaps in order to avoid long queues.      On the new benefits of the card, the minister said that the new Sassa card can be used as a savings account where beneficiaries can transfer money. There will also be no electricity or airtime deductions with the new card, said Sassa.      Sassa also cautioned beneficiaries to be wary of workers at pay points who may lie to them about the new Sassa cards. The Minister added that Sassa’s marriage with CPS, Grindrod and Net1 will officially be over in September this year. Shangu then reaffirmed that Sassa’s future is the Post Office.
