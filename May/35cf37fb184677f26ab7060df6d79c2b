Makwetu said yesterday that the history of the losses, lack of working capital and volatility in foreign exchange controls, created material uncertainty on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. He gave SAA a qualified audit opinion, meaning he could also not find some of the records of the assets of the airline. He said the airline’s liabilities exceeded its assets by R17.8bn - up from R12.3bn in 2015/16.
