CAPE TOWN - Indian utility vendors and services will find a huge market and scope in Africa, especially in South Africa's energy sector. This is according to Rajeev Singh, Indian chamber of commerce (ICC) director general and chief executive who spoke at the African utility week currently taking place at the Cape Town Convention Centre. "The primary objective of the ICC is to connect with over 7,000 industry professionals across the full spectrum of the sector to address today's challenges and implement tomorrow's solutions," Singh said. The ICC is hosting a pavilion of more than 45 suppliers of specialised technology and services for the energy sector at the event which runs for three days. He added that visitors to the Indian pavilion would be able to interact and network directly with Indian vendors who specialise in the energy sector. According to Singh, the "Indian power sector is undergoing a significant change that has redefined the industry outlook". "Sustained economic growth continues to drive electricity demand in India. The government of India's focus on attaining power for all has accelerated capacity addition in the country," he said. - African News Agency (ANA)
