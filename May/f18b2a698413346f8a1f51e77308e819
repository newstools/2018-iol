JOHANNESBURG - South African food companies in the agro-processing sector will this week seek new markets in Asia when they promote local products and services at the annual SIAL China International Trade Fair for Food in Shanghai. The Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) will lead a delegation of twenty-three local companies to SIAL China, the largest Asian food fair and a leading platform for international producers and manufacturers of food products, wines, spirits and food service equipment, from 16-18 May 2018. Rob Davies, the dti minister, said in a statement that SIAL China will offer South African business people a unique opportunity to meet market leaders of the food, beverage and hospitality industry in China, where they will establish new contacts and identify suppliers and business partners. "China ranks as the largest consumer of food and beverages with an estimated value of over one trillion Euros. It is projected to grow rapidly over the next two-decades," Davies said. "The rising levels of Chinese disposable income, increases in retail sales of consumer goods and remarkable growth for South African products such as wines puts us in a unique position to make inroads into this lucrative market." - African News Agency (ANA)
