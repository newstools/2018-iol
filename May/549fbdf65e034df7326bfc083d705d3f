BERLINÂ  - An intoxicated man's ill-advised decision to spend the night on a freight train caused commuter chaos in Munich as police had to shut down all traffic at a busy station to look for him. Munich police said Monday they received an emergency call at 5:20am from a man who said he'd woken up in a container on a train near the Pasing station, Munich's third largest, and couldn't get out. But police say the 25-year-old city man was so drunk when he entered the container he wasn't sure where it was. Police shut down all rail traffic and went train-to-train, eventually finding him at 6:20am.
