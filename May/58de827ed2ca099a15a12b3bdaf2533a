New York â€” Former "Smallville" actress Allison Mack is scheduled to appear before a federal judge in Brooklyn along with Keith Raniere, the leader of the self-help group NXIVM. Both are charged with coercing women who joined the organisation into becoming a part of a secret sub-group where they were expected to act as "slaves" and engage in sex acts. Some of the women were branded a symbol that prosecutors said contained Raniere's initials.
