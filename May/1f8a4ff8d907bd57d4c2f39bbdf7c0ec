Mouton said he was on medication to help manage and limit the symptoms of his illness and had decided to continue his role after consulting with senior executives in the company who felt he still had a role to play. “There are so many opportunities that the PSG team is currently working on. I am also proud of our ongoing contribution towards the South African economy.” PSG, whose portfolio comprises brands such as Capitec, PSG Konsult, Curro and Zeder, is seen as one of the success stories of the past two decades. The group has a 30.7% stake in the successful Capitec Bank and a majority shareholding in private education group Curro. The two companies have recorded outstanding performances over the past few years. Mouton's son Piet Mouton serves as the group's chief executive. Mouton started his career aged 22 as an articled clerk at PwC and qualified as a chartered accountant in 1973. In 1995 he was fired as managing partner by Senekal, Mouton & Kitshoff, a stockbroking firm he co-founded. He then went on to found PSG, which today has a market cap of more than R50 billion. The group’s star asset, Capitec, closed yesterday's trading session down 1.7% to R874.00, while Curro shed 5.01% to R32.01. However, PSG Konsult added 2.42% at R9.30. Mouton said despite sometimes “forgetting people’s names, repeating myself and appearing somewhat disoriented”, he still came to the office every day. “I enjoy seeing how the people at PSG endeavour daily to make a difference by working hard and smart. I regularly share the lessons learnt over the years with our team and can see how the PSG DNA of thinking and doing has taken root throughout the group.” Mouton last year donated $82 million (R1bn) of his PSG Group shares to his personal charity, the Jannie Mouton Foundation. PSG Group shares declined 1.16% yesterday to close at R222.39. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
