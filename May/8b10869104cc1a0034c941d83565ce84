INTERNATIONAL - In it's latest earnings report, Sony revealed that 19 million units of its PS4 were sold in the last fiscal year, which is a decrease over 2016’s 20 million units sold. However, its lifetime sales of the PlayStation 4 console have surpassed 76 million units since its initial launch in 2013. Sales increased 294.0 billion yen (R33 967 992 350.56)  (18%) year-on-year (a 13% increase on a constant currency basis) to 1,943.8 billion yen. This increase was primarily due to an increase in PlayStation 4 software sales, including sales through the network, the impact of foreign exchange rates, as well as an increase in the number of subscribers for PlayStation Plus, a paid membership service,” Sony said in a statement. “Sales are expected to be essentially flat year-on-year mainly due to an expected decrease in PS4 hardware sales and the impact of foreign exchange rates, substantially offset by an expected increase in PS4 software sales, including sales through the network,” the firm added. In the mobile communications segment for 2017, the company experienced sales worth 35.4 bln yen (YOY) (R4 081 443 000.00) which was a 4.7% decrease. This means that there was a decrease in smartphone unit sales. For its 2018 YOY prediction, the company says that sales will decrease: 83.7 bln yen (11.6%) (R9 670 426 460.46) decrease. They will be downsizing smartphone unit sales in an effort to improve profitability.
