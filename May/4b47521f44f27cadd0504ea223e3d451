Morgan Freeman is apologizing to anyone who may have felt "uncomfortable or disrespected" by his behaviour. His remarks come after CNN reported that multiple women have accused the A-list actor of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour on movie sets and in other professional settings. The CNN report includes one woman who says the actor repeatedly tried to lift up her skirt and asked if she was wearing underwear. Several women also say he made frequent comments about their bodies. CNN spoke to 16 people about Freeman. Eight said they had experienced harassment or inappropriate behaviour, and another eight said they witnessed such conduct.
