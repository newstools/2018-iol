Police asked the crowd gathered at the scene on Sunday to move further away from the mosque and residents on the street said they were asked to evacuate their homes. Members of the bomb squad were inside the mosque with sniffer dogs for more than two hours. The bomb squad are apparently using a specialised X-ray machine to scan the device.
