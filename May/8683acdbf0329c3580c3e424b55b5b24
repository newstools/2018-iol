Istanbul - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced a "genocide" in the Gaza Strip as he declared three days of mourning in Turkey over the Israeli killings of dozens of Palestinian protesters. Separately, a government spokesman said Turkey was recalling its ambassadors to Tel Aviv and Washington. "Israel is carrying out a genocide. I curse this drama of humanity and genocide, no matter from which side it comes from, either America or Israel," Erdogan was quoted as saying by the state-run Anadolu news agency while he visited Britain. "Israel is a state of terror," he added, on a day where more than 50 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces as the US moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
