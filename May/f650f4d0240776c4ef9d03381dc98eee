INTERNATIONAL - Apple is starting to remove apps from the App Store that violate the company’s policies by sharing location data with third parties without a user's consent, 9to5Mac reported. This is in accordance with the company's App Store guidelines, which say that apps must not transmit “user location data to third parties without explicit consent from the user or for unapproved purposes.” “Also not for purposes unrelated to improving the user experience or software/hardware performance connected to the app’s functionality.” Additionally, it is also related to the General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into effect on May 25th in Europe. The new regulation states that technology companies will need to obtain explicit and informed consent from a person they’re collecting personal data from. That means apps need to ask for consent to your data more often, or explain how they’re using your data. Apple has sent notices to developers that have violated the company’s guidelines. The company has informed them that their apps are not in compliance. The apps affected haven’t provided enough clear information to users about what happens to their data after it’s collected, According to 9to5Mac. In the notices sent to affected developers, Apple says those who want to reinstate their app must remove any code, frameworks, or SDKs that relate to location sharing with third parties, and resubmit the app for a review.     Once approved, the app will be relisted on the App Store. It’s unclear how many developers have had their apps removed.
