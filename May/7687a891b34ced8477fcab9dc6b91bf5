Johannesburg - A moving letter penned by Akhumzi’s mother, Zoleka Jezile, was read out by Andile Ncube and it left the attendees who filled the auditorium in tears. Akhumzi Jezile, the multi-talented star was today laid to rest. His funeral ceremony was held at Rhema Bible Church in Randburg and was attended by industry friends and family. Zoleka said since his passing, all she has done was cry and question God why he had to die. “I have cried to God asking why me? Why you? No other feeling can possibly be worse than this. But I also answered myself saying ‘Zo, if not you then whose child was it suppose to be? Which mother should it had been in your place? It is well my son. It is well,” she said.
