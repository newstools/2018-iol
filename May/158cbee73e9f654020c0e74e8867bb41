New Delhi - At least 84 people died as severe storms lashed
five Indian states overnight, with local agencies placed on alert
amid warnings of more bad weather ahead, officials said on Monday. Since Sunday night, high-speed winds accompanied by rain and
lightning have left a trail of destruction, bringing down homes and
leaving dozens injured. The northern state of Uttar Pradesh reported the highest death toll
at 52, according to officials at the state's disaster control room. Many of the injured had succumbed to their injuries, leading to the
raising of the death toll. As many as 131 people were injured. Fourteen people died in the eastern state of West Bengal, while
another 12 died in the southern province of Andhra Pradesh and three
in neighbouring Telangana state. Two more people died in the capital, New Delhi, while another death
was confirmed from the hill state of Uttarakhand. Most of the deaths were reportedly due to collapsing houses and
lightning strikes. Relief departments were assessing the damage in various states. Flight operations at Delhi's international airport were put on hold,
and more than 70 flights had been diverted on Sunday. The bad weather also affected train services and road traffic in
Delhi and its suburbs. "Saddened by the loss of lives due to storms. Condolences to the
bereaved families. I pray for the speedy recovery of those injured,"
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter. All the states were on high alert, as the weather bureau has warned
of more thunderstorms until Tuesday. Summer dust storms accompanied by strong winds are common in India
ahead of the rainy monsoon season. Earlier this month, northern India was hit by a powerful squall and
thunderstorms that killed more than 120 people and left scores hurt. DPA
