INTERNATIONAl - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the platform will allow users for the first time be able to clear the data from their account that keeps track of their activities on the social network. The new feature, called "Clear History," would be similar to a web browser's option for users to clear their history and cookies from the cache, Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post. "Once we roll out this update, you'll be able to see information about the apps and websites you've interacted with, and you'll be able to clear this information from your account," Zuckerberg added. Facebook has been under pressure to improve privacy controls for its users since news reports in March revealed that the data firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users. Zuckerberg said in the post that users who choose to clear the data from their Facebook profiles might have a less smooth experience on the social network. "Your Facebook won't be as good while it relearns your preferences," Zuckerberg said. READ ALSO: Just how does Facebook collect data on you?
