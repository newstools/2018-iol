DUBAI - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani
reiterated on Sunday that Tehran would remain committed to its
2015 nuclear deal if its interests can be protected and said the
U.S. withdrawal from the accord was a "violation of morals". "The U.S. withdrawal ... is a violation of morals, the
correct way to carry out politics and diplomacy and against
international regulations," Rouhani during a meeting with
visiting Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena. "If the remaining five countries continue to abide by the
agreement, Iran will remain in the deal despite the will of
America," Rouhani said in remarks carried by state television. U.S. President Donald Trump's decision on Tuesday to pull
out of the nuclear deal has upset European allies, cast
uncertainty over global oil supplies and raised the risk of
conflict in the Middle East. ALSO READ: Trump tipped to pull out of Iran nuclear deal Iran has said it will stay committed to the deal, to which
Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia are also signatories,
if powers still backing the agreement can ensure it is protected
from sanctions against key sectors of its economy such as oil. In what is seen as a last-ditch effort to save the accord
after Washington's withdrawal, Iranian foreign minister
Mohammad Javad Zarif has embarked on a tour of world powers. Reuters
