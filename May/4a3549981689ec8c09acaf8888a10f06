 Ruling the Zulu Kingdom is a mammoth task. The paltry R1million salary & R65.8million for the upkeep of the King, the royal family & their household trust cannot just be for nothing😎 — Vusi Sambo (@VusiSambo) 4 May 2018    Every royal household receives money from the government, but the amount will be based on the size of villages, it will be used to develop the community, the king as chairperson of the royal council gets a monthly salary also the traditional Cllr’s. not sure about Zulu kingdom. — Mmadikgosi Matshego (@Mmadikgosi_23) 4 May 2018    That is absurd... how dare they take so much money to one kingdom? This government is playing with our minds. They are not giving salary increment to employees hence they are able to allocate so much money to the Zulu king!!! 2019 ANC will dance on hot asshes — The great wall (@MatsimbiSm) 4 May 2018    Criticizing the King Zwelithini grant increase should never be premised on tribal lines but rather on whether or not,  in a country experiencing deficits in its purse,  such increases are sound management of government monies. 🤷 — Faku (@lean_mawish) May 4, 2018   King Zwelithini will be getting R66m annual budget. Is he still collecting R5 donation for the land? pic.twitter.com/E4WF0kCIOc — Hloni Nyetanyane (@HloniNyetanyane) May 4, 2018   Ask the Anc why Zwelithini is getting R66Million. Ask them. Kzn could do a lot with the money. He had land and an allowance.. Your leaders — ♿️ New Beginnings♿️💞 (@HumanlyAwkward) May 4, 2018    Zwelithini must get a cut, no ways. 66 M off what? I trust @CyrilRamaphosa to downgrade this guy.  — Tsonga Cupcake! (@kulanicool) May 4, 2018    @Julius_S_Malema CIC, King Zwelithini now at 65.8 m for 2018, why other Chiefs and Queens not even 1m , please assist why him  — Trevor Nkgapele (@TrevorNkgapele) May 4, 2018
