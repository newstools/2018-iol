The listed oil and chemicals group said yesterday that trading in Sasol Inzalo shares on the JSE would be suspended from tomorrow until the close of trade on May 31. It said the suspension of trading would be lifted on June 1 “and would again be suspended on Tuesday, September 4, until such shares are delisted on Friday, September 7, 2018”. Sasol said its board had decided to lift the suspension of trading in shares from June 1 so that existing and potential shareholders might, should they decide, trade Sasol Inzalo shares until the unwind date of the Sasol Inzalo. The Sasol Inzalo empowerment scheme will unwind next month and be replaced by a new fully vendor-financed Sasol Khanyisa. Sasol said last month that trading in Sasol Inzalo shares on the black economic empowerment segment of the JSE would be suspended from tomorrow until they were delisted in September, in accordance with the terms of their listing in December 2015. -BUSINESS REPORT
