NAIROBI - Kenya's top prosecutor on
Wednesday ordered nine businessmen and government officials
charged with manslaughter for their involvement in the collapse
of a dam on a rose farm that killed at least 47 people. Noordin Haji said in a statement that his office is
preparing for the suspects to be arraigned in court to answer
the charges. Among those to be charged are two managers of the commercial
farm in Nakuru County in Kenya's Rift Valley where the dam burst
in May, Haji's office said in a statement. Others who would be charged were officials from the
state-run Water Resources Management Authority, the National
Environment Management Authority and the administration of
Nakuru County. The dam on the flower farm burst after weeks of heavy rain,
sending cascades of water down a hillside where it smashed into
two villages. Haji's statement said unqualified staff had built
the dam using farm equipment, relying on flawed designs and
without the necessary environmental impact assessment. Reuters
