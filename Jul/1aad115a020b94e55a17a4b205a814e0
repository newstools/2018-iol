JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's Sun City resort is next month set to host the first Women Economic Forum in South Africa, targeted at entrepreneurs and senior managers from sectors such as education, health, agriculture, natural resource management, and financial services. The WEF is a global conference which aims to foster empowering conversations and connections among women committed to constructive change, and its vision is to inspire every woman to become a businesswoman. The theme of the Sun City meeting will be "Women and Technology". South Africa's social development minister Susan Shabangu said the participation of women in the economy was essential if we are to achieve universal development and social justice in communities. “I am personally passionate about overcoming barriers to women emancipation such as comparatively low investment in female health, education and SMME’s (Small, Medium and Micro-sized Enterprises)," Shabangu said. "I look forward to engaging firsthand with women who are at the forefront of changing the tide in the business world.” - African News Agency (ANA)
