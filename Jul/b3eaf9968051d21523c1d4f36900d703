Harare - Polls have closed in Zimbabwe's historic election, the first since the fall of longtime leader Robert Mugabe. Millions have voted, turnout was high and the day was free of the violence that marked previous elections.    Election officials in the capital Harare said polling had closed, though any citizen waiting in line to vote would be allowed to cast their ballot. The 75-year-old President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former Mugabe confidante, is in a close race with main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa. The 40-year-old Chamisa has called the election a choice between Zimbabwe's past and future. Final election results are expected within five days. A credible vote is key to lifting international sanctions and attracting foreign investment to revive Zimbabwe's shattered economy. The opposition has raised concerns about delays in urban areas and has vowed to protest if the election is flawed. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535.
