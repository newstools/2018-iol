Harare - Zimbabwe's state-run Herald newspaper has harshly criticised main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa on election day, calling him a proxy for former leader Robert Mugabe and rejecting his claims to represent change. The front-page commentary follows Sunday's remarks by the 94-year-old Mugabe that he would not vote for his former deputy President Emmerson Mnangagwa and that Chamisa is the only viable candidate. "Now this is the man who tries a comeback by proxy," The Herald said. Addressing the 40-year-old Chamisa, it continues: "You willingly become his cat's paw while masquerading as an independent man representing a new generation." Chamisa has said he'll accept the vote of Mugabe or any other Zimbabwean, saying it's not his role to discriminate. Mugabe was forced to resign in November after a military takeover and a ruling Zanu-PF party move to impeach him, just weeks after he fired the 75-year-old Mnangagwa in a ruling party feud.
