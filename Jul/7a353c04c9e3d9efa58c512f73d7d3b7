CAPE TOWN - Cell C has launched new WhatsApp bundles which will allow access to Facebook included in the deal. Cell C said that its three new bundles in the ‘ShoutOut’ range will also include access to Facebook – doubling the number of platforms that customers can use these bundles for. “We are taking the top two social apps, WhatsApp and Facebook, and giving customers access at incredible rates, from as little as R4 per day for an 80MB bundle", said Cell C in a statement. "We know customers will be excited by these new bundles as they will allow them to stay connected across their two favourite social apps,” said Cell C chief commercial officer, Junaid Munshi. Additionally, an extra R2 will be charged but data for WhatsApp will be doubled, according to Cell C. That means that for only R17, customers will now get 1200MB to use on both WhatsApp and Facebook for 30 days with ShoutOut R17. ShoutOut R4 provides customers an inexpensive daily option to access WhatsApp and Facebook. The bundle is valid for 24 hours and allows customers up to 80MB to access the two platforms. According to Cell C, this offer has been designed to provide customers more disposable income for those seeking greater value amidst tougher economic times.
