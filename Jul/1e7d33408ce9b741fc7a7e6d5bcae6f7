Johannesburg - Home Affairs director-general Mkuseli Apleni is stepping down after nearly 10 years at the department, news channel eNCA reported on Monday. Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba was expected to announce the move later in the day. Apleni was reinstated to the post last year after challenging in court, then-minister Hlengiwe Mkhize's decision to suspend him. Apleni maintained that he could only be suspended by the president of the Republic of South Africa and not the minister.  The director-general alleged that the minister wanted him out of the way so that the department could settle litigation against it involving millions of rand, which he said he had refused to do. In setting aside the suspension the court ruled that the minister of home affairs “lacked authority to suspend the applicant” and that the suspension “was unconstitutional and of no force or effect”.
