Pretoria - Gauteng African National Congress executive committee member and education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is the province's new ANC deputy chairman. Lesufi, from the Ekurhuleni region, beat education MEC Lebogang Maile at the provincial conference under way in Irene, Pretoria. Lesufi received 22 more votes than Maile. A total of 1 244 delegates voted for the last top four posts following David Makhura's election unopposed as chairman on Friday night. Twelve of the delegates did not vote, said the election agency. Former Emfuleni mayor Jacob Khawe is the new provincial secretary after he went head to head against West Rand district municipality mayor Boyce Maneli. Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko was elected deputy secretary and former Johannesburg mayor Parks Tau is the new treasurer.      The new leaders received a resounding welcome from delegates as they ascended the stage. Former provincial chairman Paul Mashatile joined them as the hall erupted and sang the popular ANC song "Phakama". The second day of the conference will mostly be dedicated to commissions, where delegates will evaluate ANC policies and are expected to report back on their decisions on Sunday.
