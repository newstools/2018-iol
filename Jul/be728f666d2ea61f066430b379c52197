In other Samsung news, The United States Patent and Trademark Office has awarded Samsung with a patent for a biometric camera for use in iris scanning and facial recognition. According to a report by Android Headlines, It will also serve as a front-facing “selfie” camera. Samsung noted that it may use the technology in smartphones, televisions, notebooks, or desktop computers. Other optional features Samsung said it may build into the module include night vision, proximity sensing, 3D time-of-flight detection, structured light for 3D sensing, and eye tracking. The report stated that Samsung’s patent revealed some of the company’s thinking around tackling problems with biometrics like iris scanning and facial recognition. Samsung said the smartphone might flash near-infra-red light when capturing an image to handle low-light scenarios. It could also include an extended depth of field lens to capture an image at close range without it resulting in a blurry picture. Ambient light may be filtered out using a bandpass system, and Samsung said it could include a processor to handle videos of an iris from the sensor.
