Baghdad - Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi has ordered the suspension of the country's electricity minister due to poor service in the sector, which helped lead to protests earlier this month. Abadi said on Twitter on Sunday that Electricity Minister Qassim al-Fahdawi will be suspended until investigations are completed. Iraq was hit by a wave of protests this month, partially due to poor electricity services during the hot summer. The protests started in the oil province of Basra and spread to other southern cities, with demonstrators demanding better electricity and water services, jobs and an end to corruption.      Protesters have attacked government buildings and the offices of political parties, stormed the international airport in the holy city of Najaf and cut off roads as part of the demonstrations. Abadi had earlier announced that he would provide funds for the electricity and water services, and health care, in Basra. dpa
