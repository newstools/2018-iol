CAPE TOWN - The 3rd Brics Media Forum took place on Wednesday the 18th of July in Cape Town and will continue on the 19th of July 2018. The theme of this year's forum focused on the BRICS Media Cooperation - Fostering an Inclusive, Just World. Dr Donald Liphoko, Chief Director of the Government Communications was one of six international key-note speakers which formed a panel of the various BRICS nations. They discussed strengthening the BRICS Narrative: Roles and responsibilities of the media. Liphoko opened the discussion by posing the following question, "Can BRICS become a vanity project or can it be an agent for greater government cooperation? He also felt that more women should be added to the "high table" of the BRICS forum, as this will bring a more diverse perspective. Liphoko represented the South African Government and described how he feels government can form better relationships with journalists so that they can bring the people of South Africa and other BRICS nations together so that they can prosper. "We learned from the Apartheid Era that the media was used to keep people apart, so this time we want to build a South Africa that people are proud to live in", said Liphoko. Liphoko challenged the media stating that they should see Brics as a way to provide improvable solutions to give life and share values for the prosperity of human life.
