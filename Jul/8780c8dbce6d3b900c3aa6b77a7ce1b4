INTERNATIONAL - Google announced that it will be working on its own hardware security keys to aid in combating phishing attacks.  How it works: 1. The security key uses cryptography to provide two-way verification. 2. It will make sure you're logging into the service you originally registered the security key with, and 3. The service will then verify that it's the correct security key as well. The company is calling the device the Titan Key and will be available in two models, both of which are FIDO-compatible and can be used across other services which support hardware key two-factor authentication. “Titan Security Key gives you even more peace of mind that your accounts are protected, with assurance from Google of the integrity of the physical key,” Google said in a post announcing the key. One of the Titan Key devices will work with Bluetooth and support mobile and desktop devices, while the other plugs into a USB port. Google said it has completely cut out phishing attacks against more than 85,000 employees. This happened when the company was testing the key internally for over a year, requiring employees to use hardware security key two-factor authentication. Google said its Titan Key is available to Google Cloud customers and will soon be listed in its online store. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
