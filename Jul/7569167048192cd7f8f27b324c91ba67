CAPE TOWN - Instagram has announced in a blog post that they will be adding a new feature to the social app that is a status indicator which will allow users to see when their friends are active on Instagram. How it works: 1. If a friend is active on the app, a green dot will appear next to their profile picture. 2.The status indicator will appear in various spaces in the Instagram app, including the direct inbox and friends list. However, users will only be able to see the online status for friends who follow them, or people they have talked to in the direct messaging section. Additionally, if you do not want to show that you are online, users will also be able to hide their activity status and turn off the ability to see when friends are active on the app using the settings menu. “DMing friends and connecting over the content you love is more fun when you know your friends are there to see it,” said Instagram. “This update gives you the ability to have more of those real-time conversations while giving you the control to hide your status altogether.” (Image provided by Instagram) Follow Business Report on Instagram here - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
