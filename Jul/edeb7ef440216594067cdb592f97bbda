Johannesburg - The DA has called on the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) to investigate why a ward councillor in the Northern Cape earns a disability grant. The ANC ward councillor, Martin Papiers from Kai !Garib Municipality, allegedly earns R1 690 in disability grant in addition to his monthly salary of R23 000. The DA claims Papiers has been earning the grant since he was elected as a ward councillor at the local government elections in 2016. The DA's Harold McGluwa said a number of people have registered complaints about Papiers for months with no success. "Papiers’ confidence in his fellow companions at the Sassa branch in Keimoes has resulted in him arrogantly challenging community members who, on numerous occasions, reported him to local Sassa officials, to no avail. These officials are aware of Papiers’ daylight robbery of state funds, but choose to turn a blind eye," said McGluwa. Papiers does not meet the minimum threshold required to earn a disability grant, said McGluwa. "Legally speaking, one only qualifies for a disability grant if you do not earn more than R78 120 if you are single or R156 240 if you are married," said McGluwa. According to Sassa rules on its website, it’s not illegal to receive a disability grant while earning income, but the agency has a means test that evaluates whether a person could qualify for the grant. This test usually weighs if a disabled person has insufficient means to support themselves. Papiers and Sassa were unavailable for comment. IOL
