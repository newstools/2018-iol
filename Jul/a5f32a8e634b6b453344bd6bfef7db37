CAPE TOWN - Facebook has officially launched a new feature called Watch Party that will let users simultaneously watch Facebook videos together. How it works:   Additionally, videos have to be hosted on Facebook itself, although they can be Live or prerecorded. Facebook first announced the feature as a test in January stating that the goal is to make watching videos a fun, social experience rather than a passive one. “As we think about video on Facebook, we’re focused on creating experiences that bring people closer together and inspire human connection instead of passive consumption,” said Fidji Simo, vice president of product at Facebook, in a blog post. "We’ve been encouraged by feedback from groups using Watch Party as we’ve been testing and rolling out. We’ve heard from group leaders that they’re excited to use Watch Party for things like: hosting Q&As around particular hobbies such as cooking or crafting, sharing behind the scenes details of a video, swapping tips and tricks for things like home improvement, decorating, or makeup tutorials with members in real time, learning new things like a workout technique or musical skills, and inviting special guests to join their Watch Party", said the company.
