JOHANNESBURG - Transport ministers from South Africa, Russia, India and China on Thursday signed a memorandum to expand and deepen cooperation in regional aviation on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Johannesburg. “We have signed this agreement on the basis of understanding and mutual benefits in order to bolster our regional aviation transport sector, to share good practice and open socio-economic and development opportunities amongst the member states,” South Africa's transport minister Blade Nzimande said. He said the signatories would share public policies and best practices, particularly in regional airports management, airport infrastructure management, air navigation services, innovation and training, particularly that of pilots. “This agreement will ensure that our country continue to have adequate and highly skilled aviation professionals who are available to operate, manage and maintain our air transport system, taking it to greater heights,” Nzimande added. -African News Agency (ANA)
