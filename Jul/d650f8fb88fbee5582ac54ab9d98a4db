INTERNATIONAL - Huawei plans to launch the world’s first foldable smartphone, according to a report from Nikkei. According to the report, Huawei will also use a flexible OLED panel for its foldable smartphone with its display manufactured by BOE Technology Group. Sources told Nikkei that Huawei’s first batch of foldable smartphones will be relatively small, but will launch before Samsung rolls out its own foldable device. Huawei’s foldable smartphone could reportedly launch in the beginning of 2019. In March, Wall Street firm Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that Apple is working with Asian partners to make a foldable iPhone to be released by 2020, as reported by CNBC. Senior analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote a note to clients today after meeting several Apple suppliers in Asia. “We expect the iPhones this fall to be largely unchanged for the OLED versions although size changes have proved to be a catalyst in the past,” Mohan wrote, “Our checks also suggest that Apple is working with suppliers on a foldable phone (that potentially could double up as a tablet) for launch in 2020", the note said. In early February, reports showed that Samsung is working on a phone with a foldable screen, which was rumored to be called the Galaxy X and was set to launch this year in 2018. The Galaxy X was reportedly shown to insiders at January's Consumer Electronic Show (CES) this year and has recently passed certification and is view-able on Samsung's support site. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
