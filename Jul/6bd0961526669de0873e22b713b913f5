Studio City, California - Tina Turner's oldest son has died aged 59. Craig Raymond Turner passed away from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in Studio City, California. Craig - who worked in real estate in the San Fernando Valley - was found at his home just after midday on Tuesday and was pronounced dead at the scene, TMZ reports. Tina was 18 when she had Craig with a saxophonist named Raymond Hill. When Tina married Ike, he adopted her son as his own. Craig's sad passing comes just a few months after Tina admitted she has "forgiven" her late ex-husband Ike. The 78-year-old singer insists she no longer bears a grudge against her former spouse - who passed away in 2007 - despite her claims he abused her and controlled her life until they split in 1976. She said: "As an old person, I have forgiven him, but I would not work with him. He asked for one more tour with me, and I said, 'No, absolutely not.' Ike wasn't someone you could forgive and allow him back in. It's all gone, all forgotten. I don't know what the dreams are about. The dreams are still there -- not the violence, the anger. I wonder if I'm still holding something in ... I felt awful. I didn't know how to say no, because I needed the work. I think I wasn't educated to handle that." Tina claims her former spouse was violent towards her because he was afraid she would leave him. She added: "There was violence, because he had this fear that I was going to leave him. The other women, because I didn't love him that way ... the other women weren't so bad, but it was the constant, constant ill treatment." Bang Showbiz
