JOHANNESBURG - Wage negotiations in South Africa's gold sector got underway between unions and producers on Wednesday. Negotiations in respect of wages and other conditions of employment between gold producers -- AngloGold Ashanti, Harmony, Sibanye-Stillwater and Village Main Reef -- and unions -- the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), Solidarity and UASA -- started on Wednesday. "The companies, led in this centralised collective bargaining forum by the Minerals Council South Africa, together directly employ around 80,000 employees in the three bargaining units engaged in negotiations which include Category 4 – 8 employees, miners and artisans, and officials," the gold producers said in a joint statement. "The primary focus of today’s proceedings was for the four unions to present and motivate their demands for consideration by the gold producers. The gold companies will consider the presentations made today, and will respond when negotiations resume on 18 July." - African News Agency (ANA)
