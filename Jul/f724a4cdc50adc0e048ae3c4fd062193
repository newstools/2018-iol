INTERNATIONAL - Computer tech company Logitech has announced that it will be acquiring microphone company Blue Microphones for $117 million (R1 5 billion) in cash. Logitech wants to expand its business and enter the high-end audio recording market to supply mics that many professional streamers, podcasters and YouTubers turn to for their audio needs. Blue, known for USB microphones such as the Snowball and Yeti, will now join Logitech’s existing portfolio of brands. Aside from Logitech and Logitech G, the company also owns Astro Gaming, Jaybird, and Ultimate Ears. “Logitech’s acquisition of Blue Microphones will accelerate our entry into a growing market and offers another way for us to help bring people’s passions (from music to blogging) to life. Joining with Blue is an adjacent opportunity for us – a new way to grow – with additional synergies related to our existing gaming, PC webcam and audio categories.  It’s exciting!”, said CEO, Bracken Darrell. Founded in 1995, Blue sells microphones that range in price from $60 (R786.33) to over $4,000 (R52,421.76) and they’re used by podcasters, musicians, and any other consumers who need higher-fidelity audio. Logitech will do its best to make sure Blue’s devices become just as essential as its own wireless keyboards and mice. "For Logitech, this is a new space. But, at the same time, it’s not at all. Gamers are already using our Logitech G webcams to stream. People are video calling with friends and family thanks to Logitech every day. And in business, our audio and video know-how is apparent every time a video meeting takes place at the office. Joining up with Blue and their microphone lines is a logical adjacent opportunity with great synergies", concluded Darrell. WATCH:   - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
