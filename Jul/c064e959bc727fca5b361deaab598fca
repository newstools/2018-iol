Paris - The mother of a French policewoman killed in an
attempted armed robbery in 2010 on Tuesday appealed to an escaped
prisoner convicted for the incident to hand himself in. "IÂ say to him, please, give yourself up," Aurelie Fouquet's mother, 
Elisabeth Fouquet, told broadcaster Europe1 two days after Redoine
Faid's helicopter-borne escape from Reau prison. "Your past will catch up with you. And please, not with blood. Let
there not be any more victims," Fouquet said. Faid was serving a 25-year-sentence for his role in planning the
attempted robbery, in which he did not directly take part. He also had a 10-year sentence to serve for a previous escape, in
2013, when he blasted his way out of jail with explosives and spent
six weeks on the run. The French police's deputy director for combatting organized crime
meanwhile said that a group of four or five accomplices were thought
to have sprung Faid from prison. "You can be sure that this particularly dangerous sort of individual,
who, I am not afraid to say it, will never be rehabilitated - when
they are in prison, they only think about escaping," Philippe Veroni
told journalists. Faid's brother, who had been with him in the prison's visiting room
when the gunmen broke in and was held for questioning until Monday,
said he had known nothing about the escape plan. "I will simply say that I had nothing to do with this escape," Brahim
Faid told broadcaster BFMTV. DPA
