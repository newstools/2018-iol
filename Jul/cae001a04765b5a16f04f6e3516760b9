INTERNATIONAL - Tom Leung, YouTube’s director of product management announced that Youtube will be testing an Explore feature that will help users easily find new channels and videos on the platform while browsing on mobile. The announcement was made on the Creator Inside channel that features videos produced by full-time employees at YouTube. The test will only be made available to a select 1 percent of iOS users and will appear as a “tab” at the bottom of the app’s home screen. Explore will recommend videos based on what viewers are already watching, but with a “broader scope” than its home screen already does. “Explore is designed to help you be exposed to different kinds of topics, videos, or channels that you might not otherwise encounter,” Leung said, “but they’re still personalized — so they’re still based on your viewing activity.” This feature may be new to Youtube but it already exists for Instagram, which aside from the personalized “for you” channel, also offers up feeds dedicated to science, sports, art, and more for users to scroll through. Twitter provides a similar service, which lets users scroll through different types of feeds that aren’t necessarily full of people that they follow. When introduced on the channel here are what some users had to say about the test: WATCH:   Follow Business Report on Instagram here - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
