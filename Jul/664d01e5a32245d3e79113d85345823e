Cape Town - Mr Qiu Xin, President of the Shanghai United Media Group, told media and delegates attending day two of the BRICS Media Forum that it was possible to ‘spread the voice of BRICS together in an era of media revolution’. “We are facing a new era and we should have a new round of innovation…This should be the pursuit of today’s media,” said Xin, who heads one of China's largest media and cultural conglomerates. He added that his organisation was eager to work with other media groups representing the BRICS nations to enhance the current BRICS narrative. “We have 20 newspapers and magazines and 10 new media formats (in our stable). Our group has been actively committed to the global spread of the China story. But our aim is to promote media cooperation and promote the golden BRICS stories – not just China’s.” Xin said that there were various ways to strengthen and enhance BRICS media cooperation. “We should hold regular BRICS Media forums. And also increase the frequency of communication - such as personnel visits, mutual websites linking and contents exchange. “We should organise joint interview activities and set up an account of ‘Voice of BRICS’ on social media to issue and update relevant information.”
