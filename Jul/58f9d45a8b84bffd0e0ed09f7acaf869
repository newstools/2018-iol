JOHANNESBURG - The Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation (better known as the Hawks) on Friday welcomed the conviction of former councillor, 59-year-old Wilma Brady, on a charge of fraud and contravention of the Public Finance Management Act. Major General Nombuso Portia Khoza said Brady, a former Councillor and Chairperson of the Oostenberg Sub-Council of the City of Cape Town, fraudulently appointed a service provider to build 33 homes worth approximately R3 million in Malibu Village, Blue Downs without following due tender processes. "She further misrepresented provincial housing department in the Western Cape by providing a document, which purports to be a letter of appointment to the service provider on behalf of the said government department," the Hawks said. "The Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Bellville found her guilty of both charges on 11 July 2018. She is expected back at court for sentencing on 17 August 2018." Khoza congratulated the Cape Townâ€™s Serious Commercial Crime Investigation Unit team for securing the ultimate conviction of a former councillor. African News Agency (ANA)
