Dynamic Outcomes’ James Paynter said monetary policy committee was between a rock and a hard place, with Treasury Bill rates suggesting a small rate increase with an economy that hardly needs more stress. “We are not playing the normal economist ‘outcome drives direction’ game Instead we will be looking at the market patterns themselves to get direction and that suggests some more downside although we could see some retracement first.” At 5pm the rand was bid 4cents stronger than Friday’s same time bid at R13.23 to the greenback. Against the pound, the local unit was largely unchanged at R17.52 and to the euro, the currency eased 1c to R15.50. Corporate treasury manager at Peregrine Treasury Solutions, Bianca Botes, said the Reserve Bank was expected to keep interest rates on hold, given the current consumer price index (CPI) level and potential upward pressure brought on by rising fuel prices, tariff hikes and a weaker currency. “The CPI is due for release on Wednesday which is likely to set the tone for this week’s MPC meeting. I’m not convinced that the rand has enough momentum to remain below R13.30, but for now it is enjoying the reprieve as the dollar remains subdued,” she said.
