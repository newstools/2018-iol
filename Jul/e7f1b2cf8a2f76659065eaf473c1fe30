JOHANNESBURG - Nigeria has opened a new Chinese-built light railway network in the capital Abuja after 11 years of construction, a rare transport project in a nation where economic growth has been stymied for generations by a lack of infrastructure development, Reuters reported. Passengers were permitted this week to ride the first phase of the Abuja light railway system, which connects the international airport with other parts of the city. - African News Agency (ANA)
