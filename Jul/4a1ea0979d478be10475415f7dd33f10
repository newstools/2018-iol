MISSOULA â€” Montana authorities say a 5-month-old infant survived about nine hours being buried under sticks and debris in the woods. The Missoula County Sheriff's Office says the baby is in good condition at a hospital and calls it a miracle that the child survived the weekend ordeal. Authorities say they were called about 8 pm Saturday about a man threatening people in the Lolo Hot Springs area of western Montana's Lolo National Forest. Deputies apprehended the man, who indicated that a baby was buried somewhere in the woods. About six hours into the search, a deputy heard a faint cry and found the infant about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. Police say 32-year-old Francis Crowley is being held on $50,000 bail. There was no information on whether Crowley had an attorney. Associated Press
