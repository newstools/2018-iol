Johannesburg - Stage one loadshedding has come to an end but the risk for more loadshedding remains high, power utility Eskom announced on Tuesday night. This comes hours after the power utility confirmed that it would implement stage one rotational loadshedding between 5pm and 10pm as the ongoing industrial action continues to disrupt operations at its power plants and stations. Eskom added that the rotational loadshedding would be implemented across the country. The power utility in a statement confirmed that although it had terminated load shedding at 8pm, the risk remained high on Wednesday from 5am due to industrial action. "Eskom has terminated Stage 1 rotational loadshedding at 8pm on July 31, 2018... the risk of rotational loadshedding remains high for tomorrow (Wednesday) from 5am, as a result of the industrial action and the impact on Eskom’s operations. Loadshedding will only be implemented if absolutely necessary. "It is important to note that the restoration of power may take longer in some areas. If customers experience outages for longer periods than announced, please contact your supplier (Eskom or the Municipality) as this may be a localised power outage." Eskom further said: "Customers are advised to keep checking their load shedding schedules on the Eskom and their municipal website, and plan on the assumption that load shedding will take place". IOL
