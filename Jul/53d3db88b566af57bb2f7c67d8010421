Brits - Protesters shut down Madibeng local municipality in the North West province on Friday. A group from Mothutlong chained the entrance to the office, accusing the municipality of removing R18 million allocated for the paving of streets. They alleged the money was now moved to Oukasie township. The group toyi-toyied in front of the locked offices and later moved to the basement parking entrance. It is suspected they wanted to prevent employees trapped inside the offices from leaving the building. Municipal spokesman Tumelo Tshabalala said the municipality would comment later. "We are all taken by surprise. I did not know there will be a protest. Management will come with a way forward," he said. A group of journalists, who were supposed to meet at the municipality to launch the Bojanala Press Club, were gathered outside the locked offices.
