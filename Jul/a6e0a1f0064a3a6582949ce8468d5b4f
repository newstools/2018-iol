JOHANNESBURG - Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir received a letter from his South Sudanese counterpart Salva Kiir on the expected resumption of oil production in September, the Sudan Tribune reported. The letter was handed over by South Sudanese Oil Minister Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth who met Bashir over the weekend. The expected oil production will resume on September 2, with an output of 45,000 barrels per day from El Toor and Toma South fields. This will be followed with oil production in Munga and Unity with maximum capacity at some fields by the end of the year. The Khartoum Declaration of Agreement was signed at the end of June and incorporated South Sudanâ€™s warring parties to commit themselves to a permanent ceasefire and a pledge to finalise a deal on the pending issues in the governance chapter of the 2015 peace agreement. Part of the declaration stated the resumption, in collaboration with the Sudanese government, of the rehabilitation of damaged oil installations in the Unity region. - African News Agency (ANA)
