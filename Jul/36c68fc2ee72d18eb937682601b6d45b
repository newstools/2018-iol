CAPE TOWN - Motorola has released a version of its Moto E5 Play smartphone running on Android Go.   The device features an 8MP rear camera and 5MP front-facing camera, along with a fingerprint sensor on the back of its rounded chassis. The Moto E5 Play is one of the first devices with Android Go to ship this year and is the first device from Motorola to run the lightweight operating system. Android Go is a version of Android 8.0 Oreo designed for budget smartphones, offering less storage and RAM usage. It’ll include fewer pre-installed apps, as well as apps that are optimized to run on devices with less storage. The operating system is lighter and cleaner, although it sacrifices a number of features to achieve this. The E5 includes some more premium features, including a fingerprint sensor and a 5.3-inch display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Motorola said its new Moto E5 Play would be available this month in various countries in Europe and Latin America for €109 (R1693.71). In the UK, the device will be available starting on July 14th and prices are £69 (R1208.09) for pre-pay or £89 (R1558.26) for SIM-only. Availability for South Africa is yet to be announced.
