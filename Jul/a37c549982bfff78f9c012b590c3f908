Islamabad - Pakistan was Sunday observing a national day of
mourning after three deadly terror attacks at political rallies
during the previous week left more than 160 people dead. The day of mourning will be held and the national flag will fly at
half mast to mourn those killed in attacks in Peshawar, Mastung and
Bannu, the prime minister's office announced the previous day. On Friday, five people were killed in the north-western city of
Bannu. Hours later, another political rally was targeted by a suicide
bomber in south-western Pakistan. At least 140, including a politician were killed in that attack in
the Mastung district of Balochistan province. The Mastung bombing was the deadliest attack in Pakistan this year. Both the Islamic State terrorist group and a faction of the Pakistani
Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. On Tuesday, the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) targeted a
political rally in north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
killing at least 20 people including a candidate for the provincial
assembly. Election violence by Islamist militants is common in Pakistan. Former
prime minister Benazir Bhutto was killed in a bomb-and-gun attack
after an election rally ahead of 2008 polls. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. DPA
