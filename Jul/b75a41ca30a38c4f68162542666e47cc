CAPE TOWN - Absa customers should be on the look-out as cyber-criminals have started taking advantage of Absa’s new logo to target the bank’s customers in an email scam across South Africa. In a phishing email using the banks re-branding, they are tricking users to click on a fake website. The scam email that is being sent to customers states that it comes from Absa CEO Maria Ramos, but comes from the email “geien0080smtp@nokwi.co.za”. It starts by informing victims that “today marks a very significant day in the Absa journey”. “With this change in name, we have the extraordinary opportunity to take the best of what we have built, and move ahead with a new purpose: to bring your possibility to life.” Additionally, the email uses Absa’s slogan, saying “We are also launching a new, fresh and vibrant Absa logo and identity that reflects our commitment to you, our customers”. Users are then encouraged to click on their “New Absa eStatements” in PDF format, which is actually an HTML file that takes users to a phishing attack website. This is what the phishing attack email looks like: Business Report reached out to Absa for comment. * This is a developing story* - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
