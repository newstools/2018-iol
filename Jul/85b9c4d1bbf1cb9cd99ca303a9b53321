Vienna - A US tourist triggered a security alert at Vienna
airport when she tried to take a World War II grenade home in her
luggage, Austrian police said Tuesday. The 24-year-old woman had found the ammunition during a hike near the
Dachstein peak in the Austrian Alps, police said. She washed the 30-centimetre-long grenade in her hotel room before
putting it into her suitcase. At the airport, the woman asked customs officials whether she could
take the find with her. The airport's departure hall was temporarily cordoned off while
munitions specialists confiscated the unexploded ordinance. DPA
