Cape Town - Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa has opened a Whatsapp broadcast list in a bid to connect with his country's citizens. Due to WhatsApp's affordability, the messaging app is believed to be the most used social media platform in Zimbabwe.Â According to a report by telecom industry regulator, Potraz, WhatsApp accounts for 44% of internet usage in Zimbabwe. "Yes, we now have a WhatsApp chat platform. A friend of mine came and asked for my WhatsApp number and I told him that I was not on WhatsApp. He said there was need for me to connect with the modern world and talk to the people," said Mnangagwa. The Zimbabwean president is slowly embracing social media. Earlier this year, Mnangagwa opened his official Facebook account. He is also on Twitter, where he tweets regularly about his State visits and meetings. To join the WhatsApp broadcast list, one should send a message on the WhatsApp number 0776 910 469. In April, Mnangagwa was listed in TIME magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2018, only five months after he was sworn in as Zimbabwe's president. Zimbabwe's elections is expected to be held on July 30, in a groundbreaking election in a post-Mugabe era. IOL
