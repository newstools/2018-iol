Greytown - Three security guards have been hospitalised after a cash-in-transit heist in KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday afternoon. According to Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo of the South African Police Services (SAPS), the incident occurred at 3.30pm as a CIT vehicle was travelling from Msinga to Greytown after collecting cash at the Msinga Mall. â€œWhile at KwaKopi between Msinga and Greytown, their vehicle was attacked by [an] unknown number of occupants travelling in two vehicles. They shot at the security vehicles causing the driver to lose control. Three guards were rescued," said Naidoo. The suspects used explosives to open up the vehicle and fled with an undisclosed amount of cash, Naidoo further explained. ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak confirmed that ER24 paramedics, along with other services, attended to the guards at the scene. "The security guards were found with minor injuries. It is believed they sustained their injuries when the vehicle overturned. One of the security guards explained that they managed to get out of the vehicle shortly after it came to a standstill. "They were not injured by the explosives." The security guards were transported by ER24 to a hospital in Pietermaritzburg for further medical care, Vermaak confirmed. Additional reporting by ANA
