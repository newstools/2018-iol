Cape Town - Renowned shisa nyama entrepreneur Mzoli Ngcawuzele is not only good at serving high-quality food to customers, he also believes in lasting quality when buying items for his eight-room house in NY111, Gugulethu. “I buy once. I invest money and get something that will last forever. It’s less maintenance that way,” says Ngcawuzele. Ngcawuzele can afford a house anywhere he wants, but he and his wife, Phindiwe, made Gugulethu their home, despite its reputation for crime. He says Gugulethu is close to his heart and he can’t imagine living anywhere else. Ngcawuzele’s spot, Mzoli’s Place, in part helped bring tourism to Gugulethu. Locals who had never ventured to a former township and foreigners flocked to weekend braais at his restaurant. The tourist hotspot is a do-it-yourself market and eatery, selling meat to patrons who in turn hire independent entrepreneurs running braai stalls on the grounds to grill the meat and prepare meals. It has become renowned as a venue for deep house and kwaito music. Take a sneak peek inside Mzoli's home.​​​  Like us on Facebook
