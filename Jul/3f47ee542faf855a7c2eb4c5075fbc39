Johannesburg - Lobby group AfriForum has confirmed it would meet with the mother of suspended tax boss Tom Moyane's alleged assault victim, just days after the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) declined to prosecute him. Cynthia Masina on Thursday expressed disappointed with the NPA's decision to not go after Moyane for allegedlyÂ "ninja-kicking" and "rugby tackling" the girl, who is also the mother of his grandson, at his home in May. "I'm just devastated... I'm scared, I wish that God could come down and approach her," Masina told 702. "I just got the news this morning [Thursday]. I haven't told her, I've just her a message for 'in case', she just needs to come home so we can pray about it." Masina vowed to continue fighting the matter and confirmed to Drum that she would approach AfriForum for assistance. AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel on Friday confirmed to IOL that Masina had approached the group for help and that a meeting has since been scheduled. "She indicated that she wanted help... there will be a meeting with her in two weeks," he said. "From our side [we can say] we are keen to see equality before the law and that's why cases involving people in high places should not fall away," he said. IOL
