CAPE TOWN -Â The Public Servants Collective Bargaining Council (PSCBC) has published its latest salary scales for members who work in the health, engineering and other associated fields in South Africa. After a long negotiation period with Government, the PSCBC and government finally agreed to a salary increase of between 7% and 6% (depending on level) for 2018, with a 2019 and 2020 salary increase up to projected CPI+1%. Additionally, Government had to find an agreeable level at which to hike salaries for public servants, while facing demands to cut the government wage bill. While these salary increases apply to the majority of public servants, there are a few groups that are exempt. Exempted groups include: 1. Senior management (pay levels above 13), 2. The South African Police Service, and 3. The National Prosecuting Authority. All other public servants employed in terms of the Public Service Act, which do not have an occupation-specific dispensation, are also covered under a general package. For these employees, their salary for 2018 will range from, 1. R89,631 (level 1) to R523,818 level 10 for lower pay levels, 2. Between R697,011 (level 11) and R973,047 (level 12) for the higher levels covered by the agreements. Here are salary ranges (level 1 to level 12) for different professions: .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg .tg-siak{background-color:#3531ff;color:#ffffff;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top} .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg .tg-siak{background-color:#3531ff;color:#ffffff;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}
