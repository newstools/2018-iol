The attempt on Razeen's life comes days after he was believed to have disappeared after he failed to appear in court to testify in his brother's trial. According to News24, authorities went to Razeen's home and found his bakkie, a key to his house as well as his cellphone. Police also spotted a blood stain on the ground.
