CHICAGO â€” A judge is charged with carrying a concealed weapon in a prohibited area after he was caught on video dropping a gun in a Chicago courthouse. A spokesman for Chief Judge Timothy Evans' office says Cook County Circuit Judge Joseph Claps has been reassigned to "nonjudicial duties," pending a review. The Associated Press left a message seeking comment Wednesday from Claps. The sheriff's department says the 70-year-old Claps was in the lobby of the Leighton Criminal Court Building on July 3, when a handgun fell from the jacket draped over Claps' arm. The department says only on-duty law enforcement officers may carry guns in the courthouse. Claps is scheduled for a court appearance next week. Associated Press
