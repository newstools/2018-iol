Cape Town - Protesters set the Gugulethu Fire Station alight on Thursday morning, forcing firefighters to vacate the premises. They stayed in the drill yard until Metro Police and Law Enforcement had dispersed the protesters. "The front of the Fire Station had sustained severe damage, including the watch room, engine bay doors and the security entrance gate," said Theo Layne, the spokesperson for the City of Cape Town's Fire and Rescue Services. The fire station was not the only building that was heavily affected by the blaze. "In addition to the fire station, the Fezeka municipal offices at the rear of the station was also set alight. One office section sustained severe damage." Firefighters from Mitchell's Plain Fire Station responded to the incident, but blockaded roadways and burning tyres left the firefighters no other choice but to take a long detour to get to the fire station. The Gugulethu Fire Station will remain closed for "at least for the remainder of the day". No injuries were reported. IOL
