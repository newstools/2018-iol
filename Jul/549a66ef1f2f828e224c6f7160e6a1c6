Johannesburg - Police in Seshego, Limpopo, are investigating the death of a 3-year-old who fell into a pit latrine and drowned at Moletji Diteteng, near Knobel Hospital on Wednesday. The toddler was his aunt's place across, where he usually plays. "His aunt took off his clothes and left him to relieve himself outside the toilet as usual. She was busy with her house chores when she noticed she had not seen the toddler for some time," said Constable Maphure Manamela.
