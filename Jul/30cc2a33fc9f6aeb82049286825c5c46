Johannesburg - The NPA has rejected representations by French arms deal manufacturer Thales Holdings to have the corruption charges against it dropped. Thales Holdings is a co-accused in the corruption case involving former president Jacob Zuma. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku has confirmed that the representations made by the company have been rejected by National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams. "We have rejected their representations. We firmly believe that there are prospects of a successful prosecution," said Mfaku. If the company is unhappy with Abraham's decision, it can still approach the court for a review. "The NDDP is the final arbitrary in terms of representations in the NPA. Now if they want to take the decision further they can institute a court review," said Mfaku. Zuma is expected to make his third appearance at Pietermaritzburg High Court on Friday. He is facing 16 charges of corruption, racketeering, fraud and money laundering linked to 783 payments he allegedly received from Thales for his facilitation in the arms deal. Thales had been awarded part of a contract to provide arms combat systems for the Navy. IOL
