CAPE TOWN - Another week, another leak. A series of tweets have surfaced focusing on Apple, showing what could be the next iPhone design. The leaks come from Ben Geskin, who took to Twitter to showcase a series of images with what is said to be the dummy versions of the next smartphones Apple plans to reveal in September. The tweets were spotted by TechCrunch and according to their report, the images look exactly like the iPhone 8 and X that the company debuted last year. When looking at the images, the only thing that’s changed on the regular variant is the introduction of an all-screen front that ups the display real estate to 5.8″. Geskin shared an image showing of screen protectors in three different sizes, with his caption on Twitter noting that they were for the new iPhone, iPhone X and iPhone X Plus, with the latter measuring 6.5″ diagonally. Whether these leaked images above are the real deal remains to be seen. As Apple’s usual September event is coming up in several weeks, this definitely won’t be the last leak we’ll see.                  Keep in mind that these are just rumoured leaks and this does not mean that the devices will look like this. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
