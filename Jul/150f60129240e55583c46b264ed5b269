Hundreds of users have taken to Twitter to voice their complaints over the app's failures. Down Detector, an outage tracker that monitors social mentions on specific topics detected the problem first across a number of European states. Snapchat is apparently down in the UK, France and Belgium. This is what a some users had to to say on Twitter.       Some users just needed to check and used Twitter to see if Snap was really down again.             One user could not hide her frustration at Snapchat.       This user had to loose out on a possible love match thanks to the outage.      This is not the fist time users have been unhappy with the social media app. In May it was reported that Snapchat was testing six-second unskippable ads in its Snapchat Shows. These ads will not be viewed in Snapchat’s Discover section or users personal stories. Instead, it will be tested in selected Snapchat Shows. The app reportedly had 173 million users last year compared to Instagram’s 700 million users. The test was reportedly expected to be rolled out on May 15. Snap chat users took to Twitter to express their irritation, even going as far as saying that they hate Snapchat, while other users said that they hope Snapchat could stop showing them these “cringey musically ads” and that they literally cannot stand Snapchat. -BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
