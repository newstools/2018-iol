JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) said on Tuesday that it hoped the 10th BRICS summit will explore ways to mitigate the threat that the United States-led trade war poses to emerging economies. Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods as part of his new tariffs policy to protect national security and the intellectual property of American businesses. China retaliated, responding with similar sized tariffs on U.S. products. SANCO national spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said that the invitation extended to African leaders to participate in the summit will promote intra-trade on the continent and shared benefits for BRICS trade partners. "South Africa must use the opportunity to expand markets for domestic goods to its BRICS partners and derive maximum benefit through beneficiation for economic recovery and job creation," Mahlangu said. "The strengths of South Africa’s trade partners will pave the way for Information Communication Technology collaboration necessary to meet the technological advances and opportunities that are presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution." The 10th BRICS Summit will be held from Wednesday to Friday in Johannesburg. - African News Agency (ANA)
