Johannesburg - The South Gauteng High Court has dismissed an application to interdict the Gauteng elective conference. The court ruled against the application saying it lacked urgency. The case was brought by disgruntled ANC members in Ekruhuleni, who wanted to interdict the party's provincial conference pending a review application being heard. The elective conference is scheduled to take place this weekend at St Georges in Tshwane. Acting chairperson and Gauteng Premier David Makhura has spoken out against efforts by some members to handled disputes at courts. He said this was a distraction for the ANC as it prepares for next year's elections. The ANC has been facing a string of litigations from disgruntled members from various provinces in the lead up to a number provincial or regional conferences. Gauteng is also facing another possible court action, as unhappy ANC members from branches in the Sedibeng region want the regional conference that took place at the end of June, to be nullified and for the newly elected regional leadership to be dissolved. Members claim there were issues with credentials at the conference. The KwaZulu-Natal ANCâ€™s provincial conference was also interdicted in June when disgruntled regions approached the courts. That halted conference will now take place this weekend, after the disputes between disgruntled members and the interim leadership were resolved. Political Bureau
