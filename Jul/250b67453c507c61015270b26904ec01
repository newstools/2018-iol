Johannesburg - Children need to be introduced to different things at school and be able to learn to specialise in fields that are important for the economy, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said on Monday. Lesufi opened an aviation school in Rhodesfield, east of Johannesburg, that will teach pupils everything about aviation and engineering. The Rhodesfield Engineering School, focusing on aviation, is Gauteng's third school of specialisation that uses nuclear technology, said Lesufi. ''That we have opened three schools that specialise in the use of nuclear is something to be proud of. We went to SAA and requested that they donate an engine for a township school. They told us that an engine of a 747 engine is expensive, and costs R320 million, but they donated the engine anyway. Today, one of our schools in Soweto has the engine...they can dismantle that engine and build it again while in a township classroom.'' He said the province plans to open a maritime school in the Vaal before the end of next year, as it continues with plans to increase specialisation schools. ''We might not have an ocean in Gauteng but we want to launch a maritime school. The ocean economy is growing, and we want our children to participate in that economy...we will be going to the Vaal and open a maritime school there...we are going to take advantage of the Vaal River and turn into an ocean for the maritime school,'' said Lesufi. The Department of Education partnered with the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) to establish specialisation schools. The project aims to create Maths, Science and ICT schools of specialisation in townships to focus on nuclear technology and its applications.
