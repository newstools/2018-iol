CAPE TOWN - Nintendo has announced a new set of Labo DIY cardboard Kits Switch accessories which will be available in September. The new package is called the Vehicle Kit and lets you build controls for a car, a submarine, and a plane. The game is played on the TV screen, and you can switch between each vehicle at will by putting a Joy-Con “key” into their controls. There’s also an acceleration pedal that works with all three vehicles. This isn’t the first Labo kit to simulate a vehicle; the first Variety Kit included a motorbike handlebar that later gained Mario Kart 8 Deluxe compatibility. How it works: 1. Insert one of the assembled Keys into any of the vehicles to enjoy a variety of fun games and activities. 2. Users can change between vehicles by just removing the key from one and slot it into another to transform from an airplane pilot to a submarine captain. “Our goal is to put smiles on the faces of everyone Nintendo touches,” said Stephan Bole, Nintendo of Europe’s COO/President. “We hope that the new Nintendo Labo: Vehicle Kit, which allows players to build three different vehicles and play with them together, will introduce totally new players to the unique combination of making, playing, and discovering." Since its introduction in April, Nintendo Labo has inspired creative minds and playful hearts alike by providing the tools and technology to make fun DIY creations and play games with your creations.
