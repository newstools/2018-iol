TreasuryOne director and head of dealing, Wichard Cilliers, said apart from the $14.7 billion (about R198bn) in investments pledged to South Africa by China, Eskom was granted a substantial loan of more than R30bn and discussions were held between the two countries to try and rebalance trade through the boosting of South African exports. “President (Cyril) Ramaphosa has been busy and it showed at the BRICS summit when some significant deals for the economy were agreed to. This helped the ZAR trade stronger on the day,” he said. By 5pm, the domestic currency had rallied 17c compared with the same time on Tuesday to R13.21 a dollar. Against the pound, the rand was 11c firmer at R17.38 and to the euro, the currency strengthened 14c to R15.43. Peregrine Treasury Solutions corporate treasury manager, Bianca Botes, said the rally in the rand seemed to have reached its top, but some momentum that could see it break below R13.30 would open the playing field to R13.10. “Bear in mind that, structurally, the economy faces severe difficulty and optimism in terms of further currency strength should be applied objectively. All things considered, these are fairly good levels at which to purchase dollars,” she said.
