London - US President Donald Trump was set to leave Britain on
Sunday for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in
Helsinki, after a four-day visit in which he faced daily protests. He had spent Saturday at his Turnberry golf course in Scotland, where
US officials said he was preparing for the meeting with the Russian
leader. An estimated 11,000 protesters took to the streets of three Scottish
cities on Saturday to show their opposition to Trump, according to
police estimates. The BBC posted a video of Trump waving at protesters who were
chanting and booing outside the golf course as he was playing. Tens of thousands of protesters had staged demonstrations across
Britain on Friday as Trump held talks with Prime Minister Theresa May
and met Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. In an interview to be broadcast by ITV from Monday, Trump said he
believed he "could probably get along very well" with Putin. "Somebody said, are you friends or enemies?" celebrity television
presenter Piers Morgan quoted Trump as telling him in the interview. "Well, it's too early to say, but right now I say we're competitors,"
Trump said, according to Morgan's article for the Daily Mail. "But for the United States, and frankly the UK and other places, to
get along with Russia and China and all of these other places ...
that's a really good thing." * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. DPA
