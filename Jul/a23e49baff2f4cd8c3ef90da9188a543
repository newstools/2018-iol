CAPE TOWN - Google has announced that it has added new features that both personalise results and provide more information about events happening in your area when using Google Search. Users can now search for an event and tap on it, an overview will be presented that shows details like ticket cost, venue reviews, time, and location. You can save events to revisit later or click through to buy tickets. Users can search with terms such as “events near me” or “free concert” and a list will be returned that aggregates from a variety of different sites. There’s also a “For You” tab that should deliver events based upon your personal interests, with categories like running, cooking, and photography. Google has provided the tools for organizers to mark up their event listings, so you should see big happenings, but also smaller meetups happening in your neighborhood. "You’ll find events from across the web--from meetup and concert sites to individual event listings from organizations and brands you love. We’ve made it easy for sites to mark up their event listings to appear in this experience, with new listings updated quickly", said Emily Fifer, Product Manager of Google Search.
