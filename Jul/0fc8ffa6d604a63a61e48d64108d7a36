Moscow - US President Donald Trump said
in a Twitter post on Monday his predecessor, Barack Obama, paid
little attention to FBI allegations of Russian election meddling
and they were only taken seriously after he was elected. "President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to
win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about
Russian Meddling, he said it couldnâ€™t happen, was no big deal, &
did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the
Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!" Trump wrote on Twitter.      Trump was referring to Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival
in the 2016 presidential election, and Peter Strzok, an FBI
agent who criticised Trump during the campaign. Reuters
