JOHANNESBURG - Alphabet Incâ€™s Loon says it will deploy its system of balloons to beam high-speed Internet access with Telkom Kenya from next year to cover rural and suburban populations, marking its first commercial deal in Africa, Reuters reported. This technology was used by US telecom operators to provide connectivity to more than 250,000 people in Puerto Rico after a hurricane last year. Kenya hopes the technology can help achieve full Internet coverage for its population. - African News Agency (ANA)
