CAPE TOWN - Apple has released a new update to iOS, version 11.4.1. In this update, there is the introduction of a USB Restricted Mode feature, bug fixes for the Find My AirPods feature, improves the reliability of mail, contacts, and note syncing for Microsoft Exchange. USB Restricted Mode feature This new update is a new security feature that Apple has added for the protection against USB devices being used by law enforcement and private companies that can crack an iPhone’s passcode and evade Apple’s usual encryption safeguards. How it works: 1. Go to Settings and check under Face ID (or Touch ID) & Passcode, you will see a new setting for USB Accessories. 2. By default, the switch is off. 3. Once off, if your iPhone or iPad has been locked for over an hour straight, iOS will no longer allow USB accessories to connect to the device 4. If you’ve got accessories that you want to continue working after your iPhone has been sitting locked for a while, you can switch the option to remove the hour limit. Apple’s decision to implement USB Restricted Mode is a boost to user privacy. “We’re constantly strengthening the security protections in every Apple product to help customers defend against hackers, identity thieves, and intrusions into their personal data,” Apple said in a statement on the feature. “We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don’t design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs.” iOS 11.4.1 can be installed through iTunes, or by using iOS 11's over-the-air Software Update feature. Any associated HomePods should be updated to their new firmware automatically. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
