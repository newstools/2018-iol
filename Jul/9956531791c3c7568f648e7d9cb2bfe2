CAPE TOWN - The official presidency website, thepresidency.gov.za, was hacked by an unknown group on Saturday. The South African presidency site is where most South Africans can access statements from the president and his government. A notice on the site said: "Hacked by Black Team. Sahara is Moroccan. And Morocco is ur Lord!". Government has since disabled the site. President Cyril Ramaphosa's spokesperson Khusela Diko told News24, "We can confirm interference with the Presidency website. Our technicians are currently investigating the incident and looking to restore it to operation". Diko said that government does not have any information as yet on the matter and cannot say who was responsible for the hack. Liberty Hack In early June Insurer Liberty Holdings said it had become the victim of a cyber attack, with an external party claiming to have seized data from the firm and demanding payment. Liberty said that it had refused to pay the money demanded by hackers who infiltrated the group’s information technology systems and extracted data from it. The chief executive of Liberty, David Munro, said the group had assembled a team of specialists to investigate the data breach. “We have engaged with the external parties to determine their intentions and we made no concessions in the face of this attempted extortion,” Munro said. “We are at an advanced stage of investigating the extent of the data breach; so far it seems to be largely e-mails and possibly attachments”. -BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
