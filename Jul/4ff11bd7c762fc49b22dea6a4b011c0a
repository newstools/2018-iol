LONDON - The U.S. Embassy in London
issued an alert on Tuesday to Americans in the British capital,
warning them to keep a low profile during President Donald
Trump's visit later this week in case protests against him turn
violent. Trump arrives in Britain on Thursday after a NATO summit and
thousands of protesters are expected to join demonstrations
during his visit, including plans to fly a blimp over parliament
portraying Trump as an orange, snarling baby. While Britain regards the United States as its closest ally,
some Britons see Trump as crude, volatile and opposed to their
values on a range of issues. His comments on militant attacks in
Britain and his re-tweeting of anti-Muslim videos posted by a
leader of a far-right UK party sparked anger. More than 50,000 people have signed up to demonstrate in
London on Friday against his visit although a counter-gathering
to welcome him is also planned. "Numerous demonstrations are being planned for July 12 to
14, 2018, surrounding the visit of the President of the United
States to the United Kingdom," the U.S. embassy said in the
alert on its website. "Several of the events are expected to attract large crowds
and there will be road closures in connection with those
events." Its advice to U.S. citizens was to "keep a low profile" and
"exercise caution if unexpectedly in the vicinity of large
gatherings that may become violent". Trump arrives in Britain on Thursday after the NATO summit
in Belgium and will stay overnight at the central London
residence of the U.S. ambassador where a high metal security
fence was erected outside. Reuters
