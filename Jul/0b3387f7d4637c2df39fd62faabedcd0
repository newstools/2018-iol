Cape Town - If you still haven't found a Mandela Day project for your company to get behind Call 2 Care may have just what you're looking for. This year the organisation is looking to complete a number of projects at St. Joseph’s school for chronically ill children in Montana, Cape Town. The organisation is inviting volunteers to assist with three different programmes. For a fee of R250 per person, participants can learn how to build sustainable, water-wise vegetable gardens with the iGardi Project, join the Revamp Project and help repaint classrooms or get stuck into preparing meals with the Community Chef project. The school, which has been in existence for 83 years, caters for 210 children of whom 60 are inpatients at St Joseph's Home. “The staff are always grateful for the additional assistance,” says Mr Petersen, the vice principal of St Joseph Roman Catholic Primary. "We’re always thankful for volunteers. If you’re able to make it to our school this Mandela Day, all the children will be eternally grateful, and they’re bound to take part in many of the educational projects." While Call to Care has been expanding their social responsibility programmes for the past few years, this year will mark the first time that the organisation is running multiple large-scale projects at the same venue. “Call 2 Care has been involved with the school for a year now, building our water-wise vegetable gardens. While the gardens provide food for the scholars, they also form part of a rehabilitation program as well as a therapy tool,” says Alex Audagnotti, Managing Director of Call 2 Care.
