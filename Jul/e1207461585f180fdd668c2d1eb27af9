EAST LONDON - The wife of late Bhisho chief of staff, Sakhekile Ndudula appeared in the East London High Court on Tuesday, in connection with his 2016 murder. Bulelwa Ndudula has been out on bail since she was arrested in 2016. She appeared calm and relaxed outside court. She allegedly shot her husband eight times in the upper body in their Cambridge West home. On Tuesday, the police officer who took photographs of the crime scene took the stand. Warrant Officer Mandla Yekani, said he found blood-stained buttons and shoe marks on the floor where the incident took place. Yekani said he also found a bullet hole in the ceiling of the couple’s main bedroom. “The buttons seemed to have been ripped off the shirt that the deceased was wearing on the day of the incident and the shoe marks indicate a struggle or a fight between individuals,” said Yekani. He added that he found blood traces in the garage, second bedroom and passage. On Monday, forensic analyst, Noneka Zizikazi Gogela, who is involved in the case, told the court that she had determined that Bulelwa could have been the person who fired the shot or was within a two-metre radius of the shooter. Gogela has worked for the South African Police Service (SAPS) forensic laboratory for 10 years. “Based on the gun residue results which I obtained from the jacket that the deceased’s wife Bulelwa was wearing on the day of the incident in 2016, the high quantity of its residue couldn’t have been transferred by the contact with the deceased,” Gogela said on Monday. The case was postponed to Thursday. African News Agency (ANA)
