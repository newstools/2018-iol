MEXICO CITY - Two explosions at fireworks
workshops outside Mexico City on Thursday killed at least 19
people, including rescue workers, and injured dozens more,
officials said, in the latest deadly blast to hit a town known
for its fireworks production. After a first blast in the municipality of Tultepec,
firefighters, police and other rescue workers arrived at the
scene when a second explosion occurred, the state government
said in a statement. "Emergency crews attended the call of the first explosion,
when a second incident occurred, killing and injuring members of
these groups," the statement said. Television images showed a plume of smoke rising over
buildings on the outskirts of Tultepec and scores of
firefighters and rescue workers at the scene. Luis Felipe Puente, the head of Mexico's civil protection
agency, told local television there were at least 19 fatalities
and 40 people injured. There has been a series of blasts at the fireworks markets,
workshops and depots in Tultepec, about 20 miles (32 km) north
of Mexico City, including a series of massive explosions in a
market in December 2016 that killed around three dozen people. Puente said the sale of fireworks in the area would be
suspended and the permits of manufacturers would be reviewed. Reuters
