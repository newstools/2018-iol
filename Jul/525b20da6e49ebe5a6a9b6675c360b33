 London - The porn star who says she had an affair with Donald Trump is to star on Celebrity Big Brother. Adult film actress Stormy Daniels – who claims she signed a non-disclosure agreement that prevents her from talking about her relationship with the US President – will be paid an astonishing £500 000 (around R 8 636 000) to take part in the reality show. However, she will remain in the house for only a week, because producers of the Channel 5 show couldn’t afford her demands for the full month of the series. The 39-year-old blonde, who is said to have signed the £100 000 gagging agreement with Mr Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen shortly before the 2016 election, agreed to the seven-day contract late last week in a deal Channel 5 hopes will boost ratings worldwide. The show starts on August 17. A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This is a real coup for the show – it will give it global pick-up. ‘The money she wanted to go into the house was so high that there was no way they could afford her for the whole four weeks, so they decided it was better to have her in for a short time than not at all. While £500 000 is a lot of money, everyone involved in the show is hoping she will be worth it.’ It comes as Miss Daniels’ lawyer said three more women have claimed they had been paid hush money to keep quiet about affairs with Mr Trump. Michael Avenatti said he was representing the women, one of whom has claimed to have become pregnant by Mr Trump.  Mail On Sunday
