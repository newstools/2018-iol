Johannesburg -Â Phillip du Plessis, the principal of Sandringham High School who was reported missing earlier this week has been found on Friday at Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital. It is alleged that du Plessis was knocked by a vehicle in Brakpan on July 5, and rushed to Charlotte Maxeke Hospital. He is in a critical but stable condition receiving necessary care in the ICU, said the Gauteng Education department. Du Plessis was last seen at Carnival City in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, where video footage showed him arriving with the school car. It was not clear whether he left the premises. The principal's disappearance resulted in panic within the school after he did not report to work on Tuesday morning when Gauteng schools reopened for the academic year's third term. The school's management then contacted district authorities and police. "We, are happy that he was found and also wish him a speedy recovery. Our prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time," said the department in a statement. The Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is set to visit him July 23. IOL
