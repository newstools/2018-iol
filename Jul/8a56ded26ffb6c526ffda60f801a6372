Cape Town - Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions Nomgcobo Jiba's visits to the office of the National Prosecuting Authority are set to land her in hot water after rights group Freedom Under Law (FUL) announced their intention to have her prosecuted for contempt of court. Last year Judge Billy Mothle granted an order that both Jiba and Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit head Lawrence Mrwebi had to face a disciplinary inquiry and they had to be suspended pending the outcome of the inquiries. He, however, suspended the implementation of this, pending the outcome of the pair’s appeal proceedings to the Supreme Court of Appeals. Judge Mothle ordered that both are prohibited from performing any functions relating to their offices in the NPA and may not enter the NPA’s offices, nor may they engage in any discussion concerning any pending cases under consideration by the NPA, pending the finalisation of their appeals before the SCA. Freedom Under Law says it will seek a contempt of court order against both Jiba and NPA boss Shaun Abrahams, who it says "are unfit for any public office". According to FUL, Abrahams conceded in a letter to them that he was aware of Jiba's visits but pleaded a misunderstanding of the judgment as well as the applicable law. IOL
