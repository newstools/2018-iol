RUSTENBURG - The Rustenburg municipality on Tuesday said it had issued a 14-day notice to three home owners to avail themselves or face charges relating to the demolition of their houses. Municipal spokesman Andrew Seome said the municipality was awaiting the response from owners of the three burnt houses and no date has been set to demolish the houses. "You may be aware that the municipality has issued a notice to that effect, awaiting the response from owners of these houses. It is too soon to talk about the date of the demolition, as it would be the last phase," he said. "Should the owners of burnt houses not avail themselves, they will be charged and houses shall be demolished and costs of the demolition shall be borne by the affected owners," Municipal manager Nqobile Sithole issued notice on July 18, toÂ  Shaik Sullen Zaheda Bibi owner of a houses in 77 Kruger Street, Rustenburg East, Hammond HR owner of a house in 19 A Leyds Street, Rustenburg East and Worldway Investment PTY LTD owner of a house in 147 Klopper Street in the inner city.
