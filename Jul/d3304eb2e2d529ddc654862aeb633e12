CAPE TOWN - SAA announced yesterday that it was in talks with potential commercial partner airlines as it pushed ahead with the implementation of its turnaround strategy. The state-owned entity said that it was making steady progress with its turnaround plans to lead the company to financial sustainability, adding that network optimisation and development was an important part of the strategy. Last November the airline embarked on a network and route rationalisation programme, part of which was the revitalisation of all alliance and partnership, including interline and code share, agreements. “In these meetings with other airlines, SAA also discussed possibilities of these airlines taking our excess cabin and flight deck crew on contract basis as part of our turnaround strategy implementation.” The airline said it had met Emirates, Turkish Airways, Qatar Airways, Kenya Airways, Air Mauritius, United Airlines and Singapore Airlines. – BUSINESS REPORT
