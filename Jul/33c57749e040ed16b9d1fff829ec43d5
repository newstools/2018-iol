CAPE TOWN - A 61-year-old woman had been arrested in Sandton for an alleged illegal electricity connection after Eskom disconnected the customer for owing the power utility an estimated R500,000 for her residential property. In a statement on Tuesday, the power utility said its security investigations department received information that a customer, who had been disconnected earlier for owing Eskom a substantial amount on her residential property, was unlawfully reconnecting the property to the electricity network. Upon arrival at the location, Eskom’s security team caught the customer in the act. She was subsequently arrested and appeared at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, June 6, on charges of tampering with essential infrastructure and was released on R1,000 bail. “Eskom appreciates the role played by the public in fighting illegal connections and infrastructure theft as this impacts power supply and overloads the system, which results in unplanned power outages. Customers who tamper with electricity not only risk electrocution to themselves but also endanger the lives of innocent citizens and will be prosecuted. "This arrest is by virtue of a joint effort between Eskom and SAPS which we believe will continue to bear fruitful outcomes. We will continue to work hard in bringing the perpetrators of such crimes to book,” said Eskom’s divisional executive for security, Tebogo Rakau. “The public can also report electricity and infrastructure theft anonymously to Crime Line on 32211 or call 0800 11 2722. The identity of those who report theft incidents remains completely protected at all times.” African News Agency (ANA)
