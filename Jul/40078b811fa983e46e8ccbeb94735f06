New Delhi - The Indian government said on Wednesday it wants
social media platform WhatsApp to take swift action to stop the
spread of fake messages that have been linked to mob lynchings in the
country. India has witnessed a series of mob lynching cases over the past
year, with a spurt in recent months, which police say were sparked by
rumours spread on social media that child kidnappers were on the
prowl. Local media has reported 23 such killings by mobs in states across
India between May 9 and July 1. Several of the victims were migrant
labourers and beggars. "Instances of lynching of innocent people have been noticed recently
because large number of irresponsible and explosive messages filled
with rumours and provocation are being circulated on WhatsApp,"
India's Information Technology Ministry had said in a statement on
Tuesday. It said it had conveyed its deep disapproval to the senior management
at WhatsApp and advised it to take measures "to prevent proliferation
of these fake and at times motivated/sensational messages." WhatsApp had sent a reply to the government on the measures it was
taking and plans it would carry out, ministry spokesman NN Kaul said. "The Indian government is satisfied with their response but we want
them to implement their assurances at the earliest." "These messages should not be difficult to contain through
application of appropriate technology," Kaul said. DPA
