INTERNATIONAL - Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S10 in three variants, instead of the usual “standard” and “plus” configurations, Forbes reported. This is because Samsung will have an “entry-level” Galaxy S10 option, which will exclude an in-display fingerprint reader – expected in the other two models. The cheaper Galaxy S10 will have the fingerprint reader mounted on the side of the device’s frame, according to the report. Each in-display fingerprint module will cost $15, which is more than seven times the price of the normal fingerprint sensor Samsung has used in its previous phones, BGR reported. It also reported that Qualcomm will supply the optical fingerprint sensors to Samsung and that the Galaxy S10+ will have a triple-lens camera system. A Korean news site called The Bell and Ice Universe have referred to the alleged new S10s as Beyond 0, Beyond 1 and Beyond 2.      While there are no hard spec leaks it is believed that the Beyond 0 will be an entry-level model that has a fingerprint scanner on the side of the device. The Beyond 1 and 2 will allegedly have FOD functionality. Samsung is reportedly planning on replacing the iris scanner on the Samsung Galaxy S10 device with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Samsung reportedly did not request that its suppliers add iris scanners with the new device, reports The Verge. However, the device will reportedly utilise facial recognition and an in-display fingerprint scanner will provide an easy way to unlock the device. The phone will also reportedly have a 5.8 inch display and the Galaxy S10 Plus will have a 6.2 inch display. Follow us on our new Instagram page HERE! - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
