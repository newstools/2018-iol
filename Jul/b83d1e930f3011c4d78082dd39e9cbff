CAPE TOWN - Eskom has agreed to meet with unions on Friday the 3rd of August to discuss the issue of bonus payments for employees. The Eskom board and management will meet with unions as workers at some of the utility's stations went on strike on Monday. It's understood they are unhappy about the ongoing dispute between Eskom and unions about the recent decision to do away with bonus payments this year. Acts of intimidation at several power stations have led to the distribution of power supply. “The way we understand bonuses is that you pay a bonus once we’ve done well in terms of finances and given Eskom’s financial position right now, it will be reckless for management if they were to offer anything", said Eskom's Khulu Phasiwe. “But I’m not trying to pre-empt as to what Eskom’s position will be when we meet on Friday.” Just recently, Eskom suffered huge losses and incurred irregular expenditure of billions of rand when the power utility paid former bosses Brian Molefe and Matshela Koko millions of rand in salaries and bonuses. Audited financial statements, tabled in Parliament, for Eskom revealed that Molefe, who was chief executive, was paid more than R6 million in 2017. In addition, he was paid a bonus of R2.1m in the same year. Molefe was paid another R958 000 in other payments. Former Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh was paid R4.8m in salaries and R1.8m in bonuses in 2017. Head of investigations in the commission Terence Nombembe, who is the former auditor-general, has also called for more people to come forward and give evidence. The commission has been granted a two-year extension by the High Court in Pretoria to hear evidence on allegations of state capture. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
