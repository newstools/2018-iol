Johannesburg - Kenyan police and Interpol have launched a hunt for three suspected drug barons. According to police, the drug barons who hail from Mombasa, fled to a neighbouring country last week, the Daily Nation reported on Monday. However, Coast Regional Police Commander Noah Mwivanda has refused to reveal the country the three fled to, just saying the government has enlisted the services of Interpol in seeking their arrest. The three have been involved in supplying heroin, cannabis and cocaine to coastal residents. During the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Mombasa last week, it emerged that at least 162 863 children smoke bhang, an edible preparation of cannabis, in school. According to a 2017 National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse survey, bhang is the preferred narcotic in Kenya, followed by heroin. African News Agency (ANA)
