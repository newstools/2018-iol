The president’s economic adviser Trudi Makhaya said in the past few months South Africa had seen a significant revaluation of South Africa’s economic prospects. “It is no secret that in the past few years the economy has performed beneath it’s potential and now we have a unique opportunity to ensure that we reach that potential, given the many opportunities that exist for investment and for taking this economy forward,” said Makhanya at the BRICS Business Council Annual meeting in Durban yesterday. BRICS Business Council chairperson Dr Iqbal Survé said South African business people and citizens tended to be unusually critical about the country’s conditions. “We do not fully appreciate the value proposition we hold which included political and macroeconomic stability, favourable government construction, deep capital markets, world class transport and strong regulatory institutions among others.” -BUSINESS REPORT
