CAPE TOWN - Research and advisory firm, Gartner has revealed that global PC shipments in the second quarter of 2018 have increased by 1.4%. The number of units in total were 62.1 million units in the second quarter of 2018, a 1.4% increase from the second quarter of 2017, according to results by Gartner. According to Gartner, this is the first quarter of year-over-year global PC shipment growth since the first quarter of 2012. However, just because the results saw a positive rise, this does not mean that there is a sign of market stability for the  PC industry just yet said Gartner analysts. “PC shipment growth in the second quarter of 2018 was driven by demand in the business market, which was offset by declining shipments in the consumer segment,” said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner. “In the consumer space, the fundamental market structure, due to changes on PC user behaviour, still remains, and continues to impact market growth. Consumers are using their smartphones for even more daily tasks, such as checking social media, calendaring, banking and shopping, which is reducing the need for a consumer PC. “In the business segment, PC momentum will weaken in two years when the replacement peak for Windows 10 passes. PC vendors should look for ways to maintain growth in the business market as the Windows 10 upgrade cycle tails off,” Kitagawa added.
