Johannesburg - Government on Monday denied it invited producer and musician Arthur Mafokate to take part in the #100MenMarch or had appointed him an ambassador of the upcoming march. This comes a day after Sunday Sun reported that the Kwaito star had pledged to attend the march, taking place in Pretoria on Tuesday. Mafokate is facing assault charges after his ex-girlfriend Busisiwe “Cici” Twala accused him of assaulting her. In an incident which happened in June last year, Mafokate allegedly caused Twala’s serious injuries after dragging her along the street in his vehicle. The Government Communications and Information System (GCIS) in a statement denied claims Mafokate was in any way a part of the march. "GCIS would like to place it on record that it has not invited Mafokate to be part of the #100MenMarch.  GCIS has not appointed him as an ambassador of the march and strongly condemn any mischievous association of the March with Mr Mafokate. The Sunday Sun associated Mafokate with the #100MenMarch independently. "Government recognises that Mafokate is facing serious charges of gender based violence and supports that the due legal processes unfold accordingly. GCIS further said: "The charges faced by Mafokate and his alleged conduct are in direct conflict of the ethos of #100MenMarch and rallying call by government and its partners to create awareness on violence against women and children". The #100MenMarch centres on the role of men in preventing violence against women and children. The campaign also aims to galvanise men across all sectors of society to respond to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s “Thuma Mina/send me” call by committing themselves to play their part in ending violence and abuse.
